236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .

227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .

186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
227_ 10	neutral	1 .

226_ 13	neutral	4 .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
182_ 23	positive	this player is an ideal purchase .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .

158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .

203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).

139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .

217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
