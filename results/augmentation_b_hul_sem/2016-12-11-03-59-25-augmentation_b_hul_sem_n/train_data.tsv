194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .

131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
