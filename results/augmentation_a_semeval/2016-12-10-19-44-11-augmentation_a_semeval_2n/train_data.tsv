1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
227_ 46	neutral	2 .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
200_ 22	neutral	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
290_ 36	neutral	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
140_ 6	positive	the moveable lcd screen is great .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
226_ 11	positive	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
127_ 6	positive	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
207_ 4	neutral	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
127_ 0	neutral	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
173_ 15	neutral	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
182_ 16	positive	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .

239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .

195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .

193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .

186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .

161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .

264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .

151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
243_ 13	negative	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .

186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .

119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).

116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .

258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
115_ 9	neutral	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .

310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .

307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .

170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .

224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .

116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .

282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .

310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !

229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
140_ 36	neutral	if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .

145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .

164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
193_ 1	neutral	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
MUSIC_107_3	positive	her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
DVDS_187_4	negative	The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""
DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
MUSIC_94_10	positive	has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered...
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
VIDEOGAMES_287_1	positive	Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
ELECTRONICS_79_1	positive	Looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
VIDEOGAMES_129_0	positive	I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
VIDEOGAMES_134_81	negative	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.

49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
227_ 13	neutral	3.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
267_ 7	positive	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
132_ 178	neutral	 The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.

0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.

183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.

142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.

114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.

270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.

225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.

274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.

193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.

132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.

137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.

310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.

106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.

206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.

0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.

179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).

89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.

262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient

258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.

132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.

66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.

132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.

193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged.
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
205_ 7	positive	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
