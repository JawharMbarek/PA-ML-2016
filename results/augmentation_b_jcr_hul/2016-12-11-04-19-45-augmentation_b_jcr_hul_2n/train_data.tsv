1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?

384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
227_ 46	neutral	2 .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
200_ 22	neutral	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
290_ 36	neutral	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
140_ 6	positive	the moveable lcd screen is great .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
226_ 11	positive	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
127_ 6	positive	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
207_ 4	neutral	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
127_ 0	neutral	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
173_ 15	neutral	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
182_ 16	positive	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .

239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .

195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .

193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .

186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .

161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .

264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .

151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
243_ 13	negative	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .

186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .

119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).

116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .

258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
115_ 9	neutral	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .

310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .

307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .

170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .

224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .

116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .

282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .

310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !

145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .

186_ 19	neutral	cons :
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .

227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .

164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
193_ 1	neutral	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
227_ 38	neutral	11 .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
215_ 17	positive	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
231_ 26	positive	it was no problem for me to use their software .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
140_ 11	neutral	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
191_ 8	neutral	here 's why :
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
229_ 2	positive	price !
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
111_ 3	positive	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
239_ 8	neutral	i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
254_ 3	neutral	i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
200_ 19	neutral	if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
220_ 22	negative	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
166_ 12	neutral	likes
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
208_ 40	neutral	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
181_ 0	positive	i just bought this player today and i already love it .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
234_ 10	neutral	thats it .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
238_ 1	neutral	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
107_ 7	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
105_ 6	positive	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
217_ 6	neutral	cons :
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
142_ 1	positive	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
162_ 3	neutral	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
186_ 30	neutral	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
126_ 0	neutral	i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
213_ 22	negative	it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
159_ 8	neutral	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
221_ 2	neutral	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
208_ 15	negative	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
224_ 22	neutral	many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
155_ 8	positive	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
297_ 5	neutral	really quiet .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
166_ 11	neutral	note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
161_ 2	positive	way less expensive than the ipod .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
246_ 9	neutral	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
197_ 2	neutral	software :
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
173_ 45	positive	the price compared to the ipod is great .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
155_ 0	neutral	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
136_ 3	neutral	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
155_ 15	positive	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
260_ 7	neutral	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
