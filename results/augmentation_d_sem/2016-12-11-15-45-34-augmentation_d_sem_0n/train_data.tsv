79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
