236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
96_ 3	positive	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
84_ 1	negative	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
38_ 1	negative	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
10_ 19	positive	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
10_ 3	negative	it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
47_ 7	negative	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
11_ 3	neutral	i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
243_ 1	neutral	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
39_ 1	neutral	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
14_ 4	neutral	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
204_ 12	neutral	weird .

73_ 6	neutral	even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
55_ 3	neutral	so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .

47_ 8	neutral	i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
76_ 1	positive	but for what i do use it is perfect .

147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .

199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .

251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .

110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .

167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .

226_ 11	positive	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
98_ 1	neutral	if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .

114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .

71_ 1	neutral	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
33_ 3	negative	i tried called apex cust service , no help .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
308_ 5	neutral	...
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
100_ 7	neutral	i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
9_ 0	positive	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
92_ 2	neutral	bait and switch .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
55_ 5	neutral	i have a dvd burner .
75_ 13	neutral	if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
66_ 10	neutral	i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
41_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
64_ 0	positive	retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
17_ 7	neutral	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
20_ 3	neutral	forget about it .
80_ 5	positive	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
72_ 2	positive	it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
81_ 2	neutral	let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
55_ 7	positive	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
207_ 4	neutral	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
97_ 3	neutral	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
34_ 0	positive	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
36_ 0	neutral	i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
41_ 7	neutral	"" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
27_ 0	neutral	i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
82_ 0	neutral	bought one for $ 49.99 .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
31_ 9	positive	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
66_ 7	neutral	it suppose to play everything .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
102_ 4	negative	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
0_ 14	neutral	the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
140_ 14	neutral	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
65_ 3	neutral	( i guess only time will tell ? )
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
0_ 19	positive	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
96_ 1	neutral	think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
54_ 5	negative	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
60_ 0	positive	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
54_ 1	positive	unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
27_ 4	neutral	my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
34_ 4	neutral	80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
92_ 6	neutral	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
11_ 1	negative	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
10_ 1	positive	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
103_ 4	negative	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
193_ 1	neutral	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
27_ 2	negative	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . ""
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
26_ 7	positive	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
140_ 22	negative	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
86_ 0	positive	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
42_ 0	negative	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
95_ 0	positive	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
221_ 2	neutral	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
0_ 13	neutral	press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
71_ 4	neutral	my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
88_ 9	neutral	1 .
6_ 1	positive	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
1_ 13	neutral	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
86_ 9	negative	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
151_ 5	neutral	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
101_ 0	neutral	i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
60_ 1	negative	the remote is a little hard to understand .
151_ 8	negative	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
53_ 2	neutral	i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
3_ 2	positive	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
101_ 8	neutral	do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
260_ 7	neutral	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
92_ 0	negative	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
6_ 7	positive	great quality picture and features .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
27_ 6	neutral	pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
23_ 5	neutral	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
13_ 6	negative	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
83_ 5	negative	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
97_ 6	neutral	apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
203_ 5	negative	* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
37_ 2	negative	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
83_ 8	neutral	it also has an optical out , which it should .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
52_ 3	negative	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
49_ 5	negative	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
72_ 3	positive	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
182_ 23	positive	this player is an ideal purchase .
59_ 3	positive	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
39_ 2	negative	there was neither picture nor sound .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
54_ 4	negative	for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
100_ 9	neutral	some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
9_ 1	negative	unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
1_ 3	positive	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
31_ 4	neutral	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
88_ 13	neutral	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
14_ 3	neutral	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
95_ 2	positive	the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
10_ 16	neutral	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
66_ 8	neutral	wrong !
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
84_ 0	neutral	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
44_ 4	positive	looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
65_ 1	neutral	so far we have only hooked up one of them .
19_ 1	neutral	it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
15_ 2	negative	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
35_ 0	negative	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
73_ 4	positive	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
43_ 8	negative	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
73_ 0	neutral	i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
47_ 6	neutral	i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
4_ 7	neutral	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
101_ 3	positive	in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera .
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
62_ 0	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
78_ 0	neutral	bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
80_ 3	negative	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
76_ 2	neutral	i was , however .
50_ 5	negative	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
68_ 1	negative	the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
243_ 13	negative	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .

83_ 0	negative	granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
49_ 6	negative	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
35_ 1	neutral	they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
82_ 2	neutral	sent mine back .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
45_ 0	positive	this thing plays everything i feed it .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
47_ 4	neutral	what a mistake !
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
33_ 9	neutral	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
0_ 9	neutral	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
1_ 17	neutral	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .

62_ 1	neutral	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
229_ 2	positive	price !
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
16_ 2	negative	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
70_ 5	negative	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
90_ 0	negative	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
99_ 9	positive	i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
10_ 14	negative	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
10_ 17	neutral	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .

298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
94_ 4	neutral	so .

172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .

238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .

197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .

170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .

119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --

189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
3_ 4	negative	will never purchase apex again .

129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .

262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
258_ 12	neutral	i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason :

32_ 7	neutral	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
58_ 0	negative	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .

140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .

161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .

127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .

15_ 1	negative	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
51_ 0	neutral	i bought this product from amazon .
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .

240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .

99_ 5	positive	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
36_ 1	positive	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .

305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .

274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
44_ 1	positive	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .

125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
4_ 5	negative	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
94_ 5	positive	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
81_ 1	negative	when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
56_ 1	positive	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
47_ 9	negative	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
12_ 3	neutral	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
239_ 8	neutral	i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
39_ 5	neutral	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
42_ 1	neutral	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
96_ 9	neutral	otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
123_ 36	neutral	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
79_ 0	positive	the dvd player is fine .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
14_ 2	neutral	one stopped working in february and the other in march .
249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
86_ 15	neutral	guess where this unit is headed ?
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .

216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
3_ 0	negative	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
31_ 1	neutral	( good going , amazon ).
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
23_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
77_ 8	neutral	so , without further adoo .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
50_ 4	negative	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
43_ 0	neutral	good :
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
86_ 7	neutral	nothing !
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
59_ 0	neutral	i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
4_ 0	positive	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
34_ 3	positive	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
9_ 4	neutral	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
50_ 1	negative	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
93_ 5	positive	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
66_ 9	neutral	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
63_ 5	negative	output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
254_ 8	neutral	my pda becames a digital album .
195_ 35	neutral	you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
62_ 2	negative	there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
34_ 6	neutral	"" check out "" !
268_ 0	positive	seriously ! i love it !
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
173_ 15	neutral	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
86_ 16	neutral	yup , right back for a refund !
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
67_ 1	negative	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
238_ 1	neutral	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
33_ 6	neutral	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
79_ 2	neutral	if the dvd is stopped , it will display "" playback only "" .
107_ 7	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
17_ 6	neutral	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
97_ 1	positive	works great !
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
49_ 7	neutral	i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
102_ 0	positive	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
90_ 4	neutral	a disipointed customer .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
34_ 2	neutral	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
97_ 4	positive	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
77_ 5	neutral	because , you will be dissapointed .
16_ 6	negative	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
87_ 3	negative	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
24_ 1	neutral	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
32_ 8	neutral	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
234_ 2	neutral	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
99_ 2	neutral	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
87_ 0	neutral	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
77_ 13	negative	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
46_ 1	positive	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
154_ 6	neutral	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
28_ 1	positive	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
36_ 7	neutral	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
92_ 1	neutral	the case had ad2600 .
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
50_ 3	negative	have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
165_ 11	positive	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
184_ 2	positive	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .

106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...

158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
29_ 0	negative	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
81_ 3	neutral	as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
224_ 47	neutral	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
101_ 7	positive	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
43_ 5	neutral	bad :
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .

231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
0_ 1	neutral	does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
18_ 3	negative	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
136_ 5	neutral	my story is based on personal usage .
0_ 4	neutral	no picture :
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
38_ 2	neutral	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
15_ 3	negative	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
302_ 14	positive	great features .. .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
77_ 19	neutral	save yourself some aggrivation .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
41_ 2	negative	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
23_ 1	neutral	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
61_ 2	neutral	i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
55_ 0	neutral	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
36_ 4	neutral	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
21_ 0	positive	well , it was nice while it lasted .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
80_ 4	neutral	also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
13_ 5	negative	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
191_ 12	neutral	3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
93_ 6	positive	good quality video .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
39_ 4	neutral	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
69_ 1	negative	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
203_ 2	positive	* slick-looking design and improved interface
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
4_ 3	negative	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
93_ 0	neutral	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
52_ 2	neutral	you get what you pay for .
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
9_ 2	negative	have had problems since the first day
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
22_ 3	negative	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
24_ 0	positive	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
80_ 0	neutral	i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
47_ 11	neutral	i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
31_ 7	neutral	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
54_ 6	positive	this player seems to work fine with everything else .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
86_ 14	neutral	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
0_ 7	neutral	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
13_ 9	neutral	fair warning - do not buy .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
54_ 2	positive	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
71_ 0	neutral	what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
40_ 1	neutral	another stupid move .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
86_ 1	positive	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
0_ 18	neutral	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
84_ 6	negative	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
66_ 6	neutral	what the heck is up with the 2600 .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
18_ 2	neutral	if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
215_ 33	neutral	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .

108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
62_ 3	negative	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .

236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
202_ 1	neutral	cheaper in every way .
12_ 2	neutral	as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
85_ 1	neutral	i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .

246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
0_ 24	positive	for the price it is a well spent investment !
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
99_ 4	positive	they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
92_ 4	neutral	what is up .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
22_ 4	neutral	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
17_ 2	positive	even viewed cds full of jpgs .
1_ 10	positive	that 's a rare and valuable feature .
77_ 6	neutral	then you can say , "" my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . ""
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
46_ 0	neutral	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
39_ 8	positive	we are overall pleased with product .
73_ 5	neutral	i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
3_ 5	negative	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
103_ 5	neutral	i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
72_ 1	negative	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
116_ 38	positive	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
48_ 3	neutral	i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
159_ 8	neutral	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
49_ 1	negative	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
6_ 2	neutral	now i need to buy myself another one !
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
85_ 0	negative	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
75_ 11	neutral	if only it played stand alone avi files .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
59_ 10	neutral	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
44_ 6	negative	and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
32_ 0	neutral	wow !
97_ 9	positive	either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
28_ 0	positive	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
13_ 0	neutral	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
69_ 7	neutral	i 'd recommend against this unit .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
93_ 4	neutral	i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
93_ 3	negative	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
138_ 6	neutral	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
98_ 2	positive	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
66_ 11	neutral	you should too .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
1_ 2	positive	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
18_ 1	neutral	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
162_ 21	positive	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
66_ 1	neutral	i bought this thing because it plays everything .
35_ 2	neutral	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
100_ 4	positive	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
13_ 8	neutral	there should have been a recall on this product .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
10_ 4	negative	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . ""
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
6_ 4	neutral	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
71_ 7	positive	amazon is awaesome !
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
94_ 1	negative	can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
62_ 5	neutral	perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy "" off "" brands .
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
13_ 3	neutral	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
88_ 1	neutral	the plus points are -
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
28_ 2	positive	loved the slim design .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
74_ 7	negative	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .

262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .

175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .

145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .

302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .

52_ 7	negative	when the player was working it was great ,but .
59_ 4	positive	the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .

288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .

0_ 22	positive	it practically plays almost everything you give it .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .

245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .

161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
54_ 3	negative	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
50_ 6	neutral	i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
61_ 4	negative	what a disappointment !

249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
69_ 6	neutral	i guess you get what you pay for .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
92_ 5	neutral	clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .

290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
75_ 8	neutral	if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
30_ 0	neutral	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
231_ 21	negative	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
46_ 2	positive	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .

160_ 6	neutral	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
49_ 4	neutral	i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
60_ 5	neutral	i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
227_ 2	neutral	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
0_ 12	neutral	you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
0_ 8	neutral	the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
36_ 2	positive	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .

121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
59_ 9	neutral	had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
33_ 1	negative	it wo n't play all of my movies .
32_ 9	neutral	consider it for a future gift too !
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
67_ 0	neutral	i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .

96_ 4	positive	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
7_ 0	neutral	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...

131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
154_ 1	neutral	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
100_ 12	neutral	( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?

132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
186_ 3	neutral	I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.

174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.

75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
0_ 69	neutral	But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
79_ 7	neutral	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.

233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.

132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.

190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.

43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.

140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.

211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!

225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.

68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.

46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.

138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.

68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.

222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
183_ 5	neutral	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....

100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.

5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.

173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.

215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.

129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.

166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.

134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.

137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !

166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.

241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
108_ 3	positive	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
102_ 0	neutral	I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.

193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.

268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
0_ 53	positive	Camera is a paper weight.

66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.

135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.

109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.

195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.

132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.

166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?

147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.

307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.

207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
191_ 24	positive	I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.

139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.

189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering

179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.

306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.

0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.

166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).

132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.

5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.

59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.

136_ 33	neutral	Follow the directions exactly.

250_ 13	neutral	You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.

132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.

132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.

298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.

278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.

3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).

36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.

183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!

76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.

40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.

60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.

221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.

211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).

106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.

135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.

132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.

132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.

106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.

0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.

186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
208_ 1	neutral	For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
183_ 42	neutral	6.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
178_ 10	neutral	Somehow the adap
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
205_ 8	neutral	With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
BOOKS_13_1	negative	Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
VIDEOGAMES_134_35	negative	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
BOOKS_7_19	negative	;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
ELECTRONICS_69_2	negative	Since I use reference material often at my work, this is an extreme disappointment...
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.
ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
DVDS_38_18	negative	Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
BOOKS_7_17	negative	Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
BOOKS_13_6	positive	I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
DVDS_30_3	negative	Just plain sucks.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
VIDEOGAMES_135_3	positive	It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
DVDS_52_1	neutral	(Dir: Susannah Grant) Jennifer is a great ""catch"" and the film isn't half bad either.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
DVDS_32_9	negative	That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
ELECTRONICS_70_5	neutral	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.
VIDEOGAMES_282_10	positive	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
DVDS_39_8	neutral	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film's end.
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
BOOKS_5_15	positive	CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading.
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
BOOKS_22_3	positive	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
VIDEOGAMES_271_10	negative	Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
BOOKS_4_7	negative	Please don't buy this novel because soon all the used book stores will have dozens of copies with hardly a page turned.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
BOOKS_7_0	negative	First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
VIDEOGAMES_287_1	positive	Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
MUSIC_86_12	negative	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
DVDS_38_38	negative	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.
BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
DVDS_53_13	positive	Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.
DVDS_35_4	negative	Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
VIDEOGAMES_127_30	negative	Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
DVDS_45_5	negative	But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
DVDS_38_42	negative	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.
DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
DVDS_37_4	negative	It never came.
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
ELECTRONICS_65_3	neutral	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?
DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
DVDS_191_28	negative	This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
BOOKS_1_5	neutral	For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.
ELECTRONICS_60_10	negative	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
DVDS_40_7	neutral	While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear.
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
BOOKS_1_2	negative	The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""
BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
DVDS_55_9	positive	The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
DVDS_48_3	negative	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
BOOKS_3_6	negative	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
DVDS_194_7	neutral	Let's! Acting from Michael Chiklis (not anymore) was OK. I just didn't get into his character the thing.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
DVDS_50_6	positive	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
DVDS_49_8	positive	Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
DVDS_49_4	positive	Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering â€“ loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
DVDS_39_7	positive	Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
ELECTRONICS_73_0	neutral	Pros: Many features, rapid rewind/fast-forward on VCR. ... Cons: Remote control somewhat difficult to learn to use, Sony service and exchange policies awful.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
DVDS_38_12	negative	She was actually doing a ""chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide"" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
ELECTRONICS_72_8	negative	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
DVDS_38_34	negative	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
DVDS_32_7	negative	The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.
DVDS_54_3	positive	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
BOOKS_11_5	positive	I was really enjoying that style of writing.
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
DVDS_52_12	positive	There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!)
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
DVDS_38_6	negative	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
ELECTRONICS_209_2	negative	My T720 has broke down several times.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
DVDS_43_10	negative	WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old ""Twilight Zone""'s, ""POLTERGEIST"", 'THE CHANGELING"", ""AUDREY ROSE"", ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and ""THE RING"" to name several off the top of my head.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
DVDS_41_13	neutral	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
DVDS_43_2	negative	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.
ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
ELECTRONICS_71_12	negative	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
MUSIC_95_1	negative	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
ELECTRONICS_73_16	negative	I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
BOOKS_10_7	negative	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
BOOKS_9_6	negative	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_58_7	negative	I only had a short time to use the unit.
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
VIDEOGAMES_129_0	positive	I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
BOOKS_2_2	negative	It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
BOOKS_5_5	negative	This is not the book for your goal.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
ELECTRONICS_220_2	neutral	Maybe I've not set it up correctly.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
DVDS_52_17	positive	There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
DVDS_45_6	negative	They should have just re-released the original.
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
MUSIC_98_5	negative	Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
MUSIC_107_3	positive	her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
ELECTRONICS_71_4	neutral	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
ELECTRONICS_71_6	negative	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
ELECTRONICS_59_1	negative	I really wish I hadn't.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
BOOKS_14_2	neutral	I could relate with Pi on his views about God and religion.
BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
DVDS_38_32	negative	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
MUSIC_94_10	positive	has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered...
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
BOOKS_22_4	positive	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
BOOKS_6_5	negative	This does not happen.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
DVDS_39_2	negative	However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
BOOKS_18_16	positive	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
DVDS_40_1	neutral	The original is actually very scary and disturbing and the remake for the 21st century has its moments and wisely a few homages to its predecessor.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
DVDS_38_35	neutral	The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with ""pretties"".
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
DVDS_187_4	negative	The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
DVDS_38_44	negative	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all.
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
VIDEOGAMES_143_11	positive	Bottom line love Star wars get it.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_271_13	negative	Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
MUSIC_95_8	negative	Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.
ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
DVDS_36_23	negative	Stay away from this film like the plague.
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.
BOOKS_13_7	negative	I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
DVDS_36_16	negative	Then there is Vin Diesel. I can guarantee you, he was a much better bouncer than he ever will be an actor.
DVDS_32_1	negative	The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
MUSIC_264_5	positive	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_79_1	positive	Looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
DVDS_38_2	neutral	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
DVDS_52_19	positive	The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
DVDS_56_9	positive	Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane â€“ keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
BOOKS_16_6	positive	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
BOOKS_5_3	negative	However, today, 60 years after it was first published , ""How to read a Book"" doesn't impress as much.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
DVDS_32_3	negative	Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
ELECTRONICS_61_6	negative	I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
BOOKS_22_0	positive	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
BOOKS_14_6	positive	But in the end it all came together.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.
BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
DVDS_31_1	negative	Robert Rodriguez camera angles, ""Matrix"" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal ""DeadAlive"" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
ELECTRONICS_72_10	negative	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.
ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_81	negative	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
ELECTRONICS_227_6	positive	Truly fantastic pictures.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.
ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
DVDS_32_0	negative	SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
BOOKS_2_6	neutral	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
DVDS_33_3	negative	The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy â€“ cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned â€“ although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.
ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
ELECTRONICS_209_1	negative	It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
