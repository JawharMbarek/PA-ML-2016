913	neutral	I think that the best way to judge movies is, like, 10 years after they're released. I think they should actually do the awards that way. I think they should have done the Academy Awards this year for movies from 1998,
1215	neutral	The part was written for Mickey Rourke and for whatever the reason they couldn't get financing with Mickey.
1334	negative	However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,
1083	neutral	I am certain that President Ahmadinejad would have wanted to give this response to President Obama himself as that would have boosted his chances of reelection,
344	neutral	The decision on captaincy was taken by keeping into account three considerations.

432	neutral	A gas pipeline is groundwork for our economy. It will link our countries more closely than the Trasncaucasian Highway.

1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's.

740	neutral	Submitting to Hamas' demands would have dealt a mortal blow to moderate elements in the Palestinian Authority and the entire Middle East, while the extremists would have been greatly strengthened,
619	negative	I am not given the floor in Moscow so why not use some of my resources and knowledge to challenge in another city where they still have the chance of a fair election? People are not happy with the way they are being treated as far as the Olympics are concerned so it won't be easy to put a United Russia stamp on this election.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

1235	negative	We are ready for the debate. I myself have been asking Stanishev for one. He sent me the invitation at 5pm and now at 8pm I am here outside his office to talk. I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,
