263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
227_ 13	neutral	3.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
122_ 10	neutral	The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
268_ 31	positive	All in all, this is a great phone.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.

272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.

287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.

183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !

251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).

211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"

221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.

227_ 10	neutral	The solution?

0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.

132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.

106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.

132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.

39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
