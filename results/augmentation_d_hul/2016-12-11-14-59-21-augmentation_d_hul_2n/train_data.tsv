195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .

206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .

237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .

207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
308_ 5	neutral	...
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
226_ 15	neutral	con :
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
173_ 0	neutral	summary
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .

276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .

221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .

260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .

173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :

138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .

179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !

148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .

215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .

140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !

182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
154_ 10	neutral	flat out
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
212_ 3	neutral	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
254_ 9	neutral	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
230_ 1	neutral	pros :
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
164_ 0	positive	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
244_ 4	neutral	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
209_ 4	positive	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
186_ 27	neutral	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
140_ 22	negative	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
110_ 9	positive	it is a very amazing product .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
215_ 17	positive	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
254_ 11	neutral	go get it .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .

256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .

155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .

154_ 3	positive	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .

184_ 5	positive	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
182_ 16	positive	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
173_ 60	neutral	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
224_ 47	neutral	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .

142_ 1	positive	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .

215_ 21	positive	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .

128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
187_ 8	negative	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
215_ 39	neutral	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
204_ 7	neutral	solution ?
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
229_ 2	positive	price !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
173_ 56	neutral	software :
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
222_ 12	negative	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
213_ 19	negative	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
274_ 24	neutral	reason ?
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
162_ 28	neutral	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
247_ 5	positive	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
208_ 15	negative	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :
155_ 0	neutral	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
136_ 3	neutral	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
186_ 30	neutral	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
166_ 0	positive	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
184_ 2	positive	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
140_ 14	neutral	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
274_ 23	negative	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
123_ 36	neutral	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
183_ 4	neutral	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
247_ 0	neutral	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
181_ 0	positive	i just bought this player today and i already love it .
299_ 3	neutral	you do take your chances with this phone .
309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
234_ 2	neutral	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
151_ 8	negative	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
115_ 8	neutral	that meant even less light and just as much action .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
215_ 55	neutral	my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music !
298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
120_ 0	neutral	i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
186_ 60	negative	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
123_ 30	neutral	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
274_ 29	neutral	24 hours ?

166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .

217_ 6	neutral	cons :
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .

144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
247_ 11	neutral	i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
162_ 3	neutral	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .

186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
154_ 6	neutral	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :

191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .

140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .

204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
109_ 8	positive	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .

285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .

206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
186_ 12	neutral	this almost made it worth the price alone .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .

173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
155_ 15	positive	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
162_ 21	positive	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .

224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .

312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
243_ 10	negative	. lens cap is a really annoying
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
222_ 1	positive	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
202_ 1	neutral	cheaper in every way .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .

236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .

226_ 7	neutral	2 .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .

138_ 4	neutral	one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" .
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .

195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .

225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .

185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .

249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
213_ 5	neutral	that 's been my experience .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
208_ 9	neutral	i do n't think so .
229_ 5	positive	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
116_ 32	neutral	instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
154_ 1	neutral	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
265_ 13	neutral	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
270_ 9	positive	8 battery life is excellent .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
210_ 8	negative	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
150_ 2	positive	i had no problems following their installation instructions .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
217_ 8	neutral	i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
262_ 16	positive	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
196_ 0	neutral	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
221_ 14	neutral	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
227_ 46	neutral	2 .

115_ 9	neutral	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
270_ 20	neutral	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
232_ 3	neutral	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
208_ 29	negative	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
208_ 50	neutral	if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
220_ 22	negative	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
105_ 5	positive	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
208_ 23	neutral	many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings .
105_ 0	positive	the camera has a wonderful set of features .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
116_ 16	neutral	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
165_ 11	positive	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
300_ 17	neutral	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
118_ 15	positive	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.

MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.

VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
1363	neutral	There was no bust-up with Ronaldo - he was nowhere near me.
932	neutral	Especially for the president, his day off every Friday has been coordinated with vice presidential office because Vice President Jusuf Kalla will also take his day off but I don't know what day,
499	negative	Getting someone else to take the rap is a classic device, but John Denham cannot escape responsibility for this mess. Now the focus must be on tackling the serious crisis that threatens the viability of colleges and the training prospects of thousands of young people.
1497	neutral	it is time for Myanmar proved to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the world that road map to democracy could proceed,
742	negative	The results were tampered with 100 percent by Kurds and the Iraqi Islamic Party,
1237	positive	We didn't really get ourselves in the game. We were a little bit short on the runs and then Sehwag and Gambhir played outstandingly to take the game away from us.
1227	neutral	Christian Chivu, Walter Samuel, Materazzi and Burdisso are out.
1394	neutral	While not shying away from the serious differences of opinion that remain between NATO and Russia, in particular about Georgia, we also acknowledge that we have obvious common interests with Russia: Afghanistan is one, but counterterrorism and the fight against WMD proliferation are others,
1376	positive	I haven't made the team yet but Walcott and Eduardo will certainly be in the squad. The more resources you have the better it is and they are two guys who can score goals,
631	neutral	We are not here for joke. We are here to see what we can do to ensure that we take home West Portland for the People's National Party,
1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,
765	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1185	neutral	I believe Ozawa will decide on his own fate. As secretary-general, I will make every effort to get the entire party together behind whatever that decision is and I pledge to work together with unity.
975	neutral	The Secretary-General is deeply saddened and dismayed by the assassinations of President Joao Bernardo Vieira and his Chief of General Staff, General Batista Tagme Na Waie,
762	negative	Once again, in her eagerness to hide Labour's cosy relationship with Sir Fred Goodwin and his government-endorsed perks, Harriet Harman has ignored the facts. 'Instead of worrying so much about her campaign to succeed Gordon Brown, she should focus on mastering the detail.
1409	neutral	Hopefully, appropriate Pakistani officials worry as we do that their civilians could become nuclear targets — as could NATO soldiers in neighboring Afghanistan or civilians in any number of Western countries,
1417	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense, I do not expect Obama to make any...negative statement,
1211	positive	The callous murder of Isithwalandwe Chris Hani in 1993 struck a grave blow to those South Africans who regarded him as a hero of the liberation struggle, and threatened to derail the process towards a political settlement in this country,
539	positive	Our generation has so much to take on our shoulders when His Holiness passes. The Dalai Lama has unified the hearts of all Tibetans,
1571	positive	We chose the Hawaii Children's Cancer Foundation in honor of Mrs. Madelyn Dunham, President Obama's grandmother, who passed away in Honolulu after her valiant battle with cancer,
1057	neutral	Gazprom will deliver Turkmen gas purchased by Russia to northern Iran in exchange for gas deliveries from southern Iran to Gulf countries,
740	neutral	Submitting to Hamas' demands would have dealt a mortal blow to moderate elements in the Palestinian Authority and the entire Middle East, while the extremists would have been greatly strengthened,
1209	neutral	Mrs Hani is a victim. The loss of her husband [due to Derby-Lewis' actions] has made her a victim. By participating, there is some comfort to the victim.
341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,
409	neutral	Low carbon growth is the only growth story, because high carbon growth would eventually choke itself off. The world would react strongly to an America lead as we go forward to build an international deal at the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen at the end of this year.
354	neutral	We know about Deputy Dempsey now.
675	negative	I am astonished that Brian Lenihan has decided to allow executives in AIB and Bank of Ireland to continue to draw salaries of €500,000.
1477	negative	ETA is the threat that hangs over all elections in the Basque Country,
612	neutral	We are still a weak country, under political and international pressure, and we had mistakes like the escape of Goran Hadzic, but the problem that the Hague has needs to be sought in the court itself, not in Belgrade
594	neutral	The European Union of course rejects each act of violence and if a new chef d'etat is established by pure force, military force, or against the constitution, that is not somebody we consider.

321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?

132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
