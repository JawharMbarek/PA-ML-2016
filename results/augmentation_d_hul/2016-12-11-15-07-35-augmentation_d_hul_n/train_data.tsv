195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .

206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .

237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .

207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
308_ 5	neutral	...
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
226_ 15	neutral	con :
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
173_ 0	neutral	summary
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .

276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .

221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .

260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .

173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :

138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .

179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !

148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .

215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .

140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !

182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
154_ 10	neutral	flat out
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
212_ 3	neutral	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.

VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.

ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10

ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.

DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.

VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.

VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.

531	neutral	Congress has an animosity towards Varun's family which is a known fact. No action was taken against Antulay's anti-national comments. Kapil Sibal reacted even before the Election Commission (EC) issued any statements, which clearly denotes their ill feeling towards Varun's family because they are with the BJP
1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase.

596	neutral	The perspective for all the countries of the Western Balkans to be part of the European Union is open. Nobody has changed that policy,

1389	neutral	We'll also, if need be, represent Kosovo, like for instance in the CEFTA.

409	neutral	Low carbon growth is the only growth story, because high carbon growth would eventually choke itself off.

1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,
1530	neutral	If indeed after June we have no more UN or OSCE mission, then Georgia's need (for security) will concentrate on EUMM ...

96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
320_ 4	neutral	In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
