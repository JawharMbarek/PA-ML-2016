422	negative	I called Mihai, I talked to him; he said that certainly, if the offer comes from the party leader, then he agrees. I talked to Mircea Geoana, and he said that he would contact him, in a first stage. I found out, after a week, talking to Mihai, that he had not been contacted by anyone,
1174	negative	The police do nothing. When we first went to them and told them that spurious liquor was killing people here, they just laughed t us. They said they had all died their natural deaths. Now, we will make sure that this mafia is completely rooted out of this area,

212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
1245	neutral	We will continue to be surprised on the bearish side by the data that's coming out - this keeps the demand deterioration argument very much alive, and pushes the OPEC production cuts to the backburner, precluding OPEC from becoming a significant force in this market,
1011	neutral	Could he really have believed that we wouldn't attack at the San Siro?
822	neutral	Simulation is not new but I think we did really bring it to Formula One more aggressively than anyone has in the past and hopefully that will give us an advantage this season,

442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2

1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's.

296	positive	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.

1093	neutral	I wish that the year 1388 be the year of peace, happiness and prosperity for all Afghans. A large pole adorned with colourful flags was then hoisted-a key moment broadcast live on television during which some believe prayers can be answered and miracles happen. Many of the estimated 10,000 people who packed their shrine for the event told AFP they would pray for peace. Others like Ahmad Shah asked for good health or prosperity. I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,

645	negative	Only an NGO like Amnesty International that has no political responsibility has allowed itself to make such allegations based on very partial enquiries and to launch a call to the UN on the basis of partial testimonies and newspaper clippings is totally irresponsible,
1479	neutral	President Emil Boc made a briefing connected with the stage of the discussions with IMF, the European Commission and the World Bank. It is an accelerated agenda of the discussions, and the president emphasized the preventive character of the loan meant to counter the effects of the world economic crisis,

198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,

267	neutral	because UN Security Council resolution 1718 does not directly ban the launching of satellites but does ban launching ballistic missiles,
531	neutral	Congress has an animosity towards Varun's family which is a known fact. No action was taken against Antulay's anti-national comments. Kapil Sibal reacted even before the Election Commission (EC) issued any statements, which clearly denotes their ill feeling towards Varun's family because they are with the BJP
