1355	negative	Microsoft did not tell us anything thus far
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission.

142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.

570	neutral	I am happy to announce the alliance. We would campaign together for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections,
829	neutral	These statements show the depravity of this man's beliefs. They must incite hatred and encourage terrorism, and I would encourage the Metropolitan Police to investigate them as rigorously as possible.
48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.

198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford.
