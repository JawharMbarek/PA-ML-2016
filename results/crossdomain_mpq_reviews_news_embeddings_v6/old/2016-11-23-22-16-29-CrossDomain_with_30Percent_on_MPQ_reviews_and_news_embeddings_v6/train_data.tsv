608	neutral	They are violating all agreements, which say that we should decide on everything together. I think this is a nearsighted policy, and it will not do any good either to the European Union or to Ukraine,
1189	neutral	Orszag told reporters. Deficits so big put upward pressure on interest rates as the government offers more attractive interest rates to attract borrowers. I think deficits of 5 percent (of GDP) are unsupportable,

205	negative	There have been rumours of a secret Heathrow deal between the Government and BAA, and these revelations will only add to people's justifiable suspicions. 'The questions now are, what did Mandelson and his friend Rudd discuss, were minutes taken, who offered what to whom and what was agreed? The same questions need to be answered about the meetings between Rudd and Lord Adonis.

1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
59	negative	This is a direct result of Gordon Brown's reckless failure to provide enough prison places. Releasing criminals early has already resulted in three murders and over a thousand other crimes. It is unacceptable and Ministers must scrap this policy now.
626	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
594	neutral	The European Union of course rejects each act of violence and if a new chef d'etat is established by pure force, military force, or against the constitution, that is not somebody we consider.

1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

1150	neutral	Unfortunately, the banning by Hamas coincides with Israel's decision to ban the marking of the event in Jerusalem,
490	negative	Talk of a Grand Strategy betrays the real intentions of the European Commission. 'The idea that we might turn our military bases over to the EU, for projects the British people have never given their assent to, is a twisted fantasy.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.
1334	negative	However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,
783	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

1381	negative	We should all be extremely worried that the Bank of England appears to have abandoned its core remit, which is to safeguard the nation against inflation. 'By providing massive monetary stimulus while inflation is still way above the two per cent target, the Bank of England is flying blind. 'Make no mistake, this will most likely mean a massive inflationary problem in years to come. 'This quantitative easing is a giant gamble, a leap in the dark, with taxpayers

1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more.

However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament.

220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1194	negative	Tory plans to raise revenue looked flaky six months ago, but now we are in a recession they look even more like fantasy figures. 'With the Shadow Cabinet clearly confused, it is time that David Cameron came clean on what tax rises or spending cuts he will make to plug the holes in his tax plans.
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission.

261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,

384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century.
