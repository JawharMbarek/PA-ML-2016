European retailers are in a unique position to help us get there. They are a part of consumers' everyday life and can have an immediate impact on the choices they make. That is why I am truly happy to launch the Forum today, alongside Commissioner Dimas. And I believe this is a good starting point for a concerted approach among reta

827	neutral	The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities,
681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition. The Labor Party is perceived as the party that started the peace process, the Oslo process.

44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives.

The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked.

34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.
1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.
558	neutral	If the Congress strength in the next Lok Sabha exceeds 130-135, Manmohan Singh will become PM in all probability. If that party's strength is reduced to a number less than 120, a leader of the any of the UPA allies can stake his claim for the top job
496	neutral	Fine Gael welcome him wholeheartedly and unreservedly . . . that welcome extends also from our two sitting TDs in Galway East.
309	positive	The challenge for everyone is that (Obama's new language) is a prelude to a sincere change (of direction) in US and European foreign policy,
51	negative	Gordon Brown should stop dithering and stop these plans in their tracks.
1011	neutral	Could he really have believed that we wouldn't attack at the San Siro?
499	negative	Getting someone else to take the rap is a classic device, but John Denham cannot escape responsibility for this mess. Now the focus must be on tackling the serious crisis that threatens the viability of colleges and the training prospects of thousands of young people.
1282	negative	such a conspiracy will become counterproductive and boomerang on the Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati.
526	neutral	As the department of transport we are delighted that this is once again an accomplishment of an important milestone in fulfilling the Fifa requirements for the World Cup,
1020	negative	We must acknowledge that most in the financial community, including those of us at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the tell-tale signs of financial system excess,
608	neutral	They are violating all agreements, which say that we should decide on everything together. I think this is a nearsighted policy, and it will not do any good either to the European Union or to Ukraine,
1189	neutral	Orszag told reporters. Deficits so big put upward pressure on interest rates as the government offers more attractive interest rates to attract borrowers. I think deficits of 5 percent (of GDP) are unsupportable,
338	neutral	Prior to Rod Blagojevich, we had George Ryan, and he's in jail,
1507	neutral	If Varun Gandhi's comments are correct, then it is very unfortunate,
61	neutral	We are interested in continuity, stability and legitimacy in the period between the formal end of President Karzai's mandate on May 22 until August 20,
593	neutral	Given the fact that we called for closure of Guantanamo, there's a compelling logic to be responsive to the situation and to see what way we can help, within the context of the European Union as well,
1393	neutral	While it is 100 percent an Afghan decision when the elections take place, from a technical point of view, this (date) works for NATO and ISAF (the International Security Assistance Force),
432	neutral	A gas pipeline is groundwork for our economy. It will link our countries more closely than the Trasncaucasian Highway. I met with Alexei Miller at Gazprom the other day, and he told me that Gazprom would keep its promise regardless, and that the gas pipeline would be commissioned in the third quarter of this year,
122	negative	This hit on tax receipts is a real blow to Alastair Darling's budget hopes,
1210	neutral	There can be no greater injury than the killing of one's spouse. The attempts to make the position of Mrs Hani irrelevant is completely out of context with our common law,
773	neutral	We intend to do whatever we can to encourage maximum take up of this exemption by our member states. Micro entities could save as much as €1,200 each year, if member states follow our lead on this one. In the current climate, that is no mean saving,
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,

346	neutral	We are the only city where Wall Street is just a subway stop away from Main Street. White-collar crime, as we have seen, affects our pensions, affects our not-for-profit institutions and it affects our businesses,
1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
626	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
594	neutral	The European Union of course rejects each act of violence and if a new chef d'etat is established by pure force, military force, or against the constitution, that is not somebody we consider.
1053	positive	Francis Maude has always been open and transparent about his outside interests.
388	neutral	If the Chinalco deal with Rio Tinto goes ahead the communist bosses in Beijing will exert control over the management of Rio Tinto's Australian mineral resources,

47	negative	Last autumn Gordon Brown was boasting about how he masterminded the Lloyds takeover of HBOS and now he's saying it's got nothing to do with him. Macavity is back,
188	negative	This is a personal-political matter on Lieberman's part. He is leading this proposal only to enable the 200,000 Russians who immigrated to Israel and then emigrated to take part in elections and get their vote at the polling station.
705	neutral	The Afghan National Army's commandos and soldiers are taking the lead in Afghanistan's health care. The welfare of the Afghan people is uppermost in the minds of the country's security forces,
374	neutral	With South Africa having just concluded its Human Rights Day celebrations, it beggars belief that our government would go out of its way to block the Dalai Lama -- an apostle of peace, who is revered throughout the world for his unwavering commitment to non-violence, human rights and cultural freedom -- from entering the country,
1311	neutral	The ad will air on all broadcast stations in Albany through Monday. Please see a statement on the ad below from Governor Tim Kaine , Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

165	neutral	Mrs Clinton's response was very positive,
1150	neutral	Unfortunately, the banning by Hamas coincides with Israel's decision to ban the marking of the event in Jerusalem,
490	negative	Talk of a Grand Strategy betrays the real intentions of the European Commission. 'The idea that we might turn our military bases over to the EU, for projects the British people have never given their assent to, is a twisted fantasy.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.
1334	negative	However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,
783	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
466	neutral	Al Qaeda has succeeded in regenerating itself over the last seven years, and it is again a threat to the United States homeland and to American influence around the world and to our allies around the world,
664	neutral	We urge all Afghans to support this ruling by the Supreme Court and to focus on the elections to be held on August the 22nd, rather that continuing to question the status of their government,
770	neutral	given the serious pressure that the Irish Prison Service has been experiencing during the last 12 to 18 months, in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit. This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.
77	neutral	We are going ahead with the operations and we are on the right track, but it's not yet official that Beckham will stay at Milan,
649	neutral	You've got the combination of a political crisis precipitated by the recent Supreme Court judgment, so democratic politicians are not coming together to fight terrorism.
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,
855	neutral	A defeat like this does have an effect too. When I was a player, I lost my first two Davis Cup matches in the Czech Republic, before winning the trophy at a later stage.
740	neutral	Submitting to Hamas' demands would have dealt a mortal blow to moderate elements in the Palestinian Authority and the entire Middle East, while the extremists would have been greatly strengthened,
325	neutral	We've made hundreds of billions of dollars of changes (from Obama's budget request) to make this work, to get down to the deficit goal and at the same time maintain the president's priorities in education, energy and healthcare,
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.
40	negative	Gordon Brown seemed to offer a lot of warm words but very few hard plans to fight the recession which has engulfed the world economy and his government.
1470	neutral	It is possible to assume that [Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert's emissaries in Cairo will return to Israel with a deal for Shalit's return,
645	negative	Only an NGO like Amnesty International that has no political responsibility has allowed itself to make such allegations based on very partial enquiries and to launch a call to the UN on the basis of partial testimonies and newspaper clippings is totally irresponsible,
256	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,
501	neutral	Within a year I won my first World Cup victory, my first world championship medal and my first downhill. What more could I wish for?

1085	neutral	LeBron defended the last few minutes on Kevin Martin,
179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.

1356	negative	Microsoft should have done this a long time ago,
1484	negative	The truth is that Secretary Geithner didn't inherit the policy of throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at failing companies -- he helped create it,
26	positive	This cohesion around the party of the majority, its chairman (Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev... this support is crucial today when the economic crisis is trying to grip Russia,
294	positive	President Obama has stated quite clearly what we all believe,
1440	positive	We need Russia for the resolution of European and global problems. That is why I think it would be good for Russia to join NATO,
1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more. Isn't this a direct admission that people who vote for BSP and DPS cannot ever read the ballots?
269	neutral	This 90-mile single-track rail line now has only two passing loops on the entire length and Network Rail can give no date for the necessary repairs to the loops at Llandovery, Llandeilo and Knighton.
1453	positive	President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, the Speaker and Prime Minister have demonstrated responsible leadership in all fields and the unity Government is now functioning from the capital,
765	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
596	neutral	The perspective for all the countries of the Western Balkans to be part of the European Union is open. Nobody has changed that policy,
1436	neutral	I can say that Russia has not so far taken a decision to restore full-scale cooperation with NATO, above all in its military component,
97	negative	I am not afraid of Benjamin Netanyahu. I won't serve as a fig leaf to anyone, and I won't be anyone's dead weight. We will be the counter force that will prevent the formation of a narrow right wing government, and ensure the establishment of a real government that will take care of the Israeli people,
576	negative	Víctor Hugo Cárdenas should ask himself what harm he might have caused his neighbors for them to condemn him.

1516	neutral	If the Government meets the ultimatum of the Alliance for Georgia and calls a referendum, the rest of the opposition will join the initiative. If the Government snubs the referendum call then Alasania's Alliance will have to embrace the idea of the demonstrations. So, much will be seen when the term of the ultimatum expires,

312	negative	It is an embarrassment for the Obama administration to continue the Bush administration's practice of refusing dialogues with others,
110	negative	It seemed in the past that the ODS was reluctant to name things with their real names. Only after they came to realise that Klaus has completely betrayed them they are starting doing so,
445	neutral	I firmly believe that voting along with Communists and the Social Democrats against the government is such an argument in favour of the end of their party membership that no one can question,
135	neutral	&gt;European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee has adopted by a large majority Jean-Luc Dehaene's Report analysing the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the power equilibrium within the European Union. J ean-Luc Dehaene MEP emphasises that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to important shifts in the competences of the various European institutions. In the future, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will be on the same footing as regards budgetary powers and legislative work, with c

980	neutral	Riquelme, I need him in the final 20 metres so he can link with (Carlos) Tevez, (Sergio) Aguero and Lionel Messi and peel off an opponent. I like it when he uses his speed to spray around decisive passes and also get on the scoresheet. If he's not doing that he is of no use to me,
1421	neutral	When Gen de Gaulle decided to pull France out of the integrated Nato command,
1097	positive	The Hon. Minister of Finance's (Tendai Biti's) thrust on capacity enhancement in our productive sectors, as well as an incisive focus on social safety nets are all robust policy anchors that should see us emerge a much more self-reliant and equitable economy,

87	negative	who could be weaker than Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister who could not even remove a senior Cabinet minister for not attending a single Cabinet meeting for one full year
609	neutral	Let me say very clearly that the way the European Union will relate to an [Israeli] government that is not committed to a two-state solution will be very, very different,

185	positive	John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national greatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and strength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our
438	neutral	the White House intends to reissue a regulation that will be very similar, requiring cash be paid before it goes.
1532	neutral	The only way to do this is to depoliticize the debate and focus on a practical necessity of robust OSCE presence Flexibility on all sides is the key word.
1161	neutral	There is a drop in rocket attacks and only one rocket from a small organization was fired in recent days. There are two reasons for this: Hamas is not interested in an escalation that will result in another confrontation with Israel, Hamas is making arrests before attacks are carried out. Also, Hamas signed an agreement with the Islamic Jihad saying it would avoid such attacks in the near future,
530	negative	This was a make or break fight for Amir Khan. I felt so completely easy, catching him with jabs. I felt like I was on a better level than him.
1203	negative	We cannot continue with a postcode lottery where people like the Tadley residents can't have access to NHS dentistry.
1380	neutral	As the Bank of England is to try quantitative easing, this should, theoretically, encourage banks and building societies to lend more to their customers,
1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.
1022	negative	The Common Agricultural Policy in its current form doesn't serve the best interests of the farming industry or consumers across Europe, which is why we've consistently pushed for far-reaching reform.
1385	neutral	We are going to get some more commentary out of Geithner and maybe some more detail on the bank rescue so we'll see if that helps or if it hurts,
119	neutral	I do not believe that the left has taken over. Those who think so, must look at the ANC statements and the statements of our likely president (Jacob Zuma) and find out if there is likeliness of moving to the left,
984	neutral	The transfer of authority from elected local councils to a new quango, which will make more planning decisions than in any other National Park, is a step in precisely the wrong direction at a time when local communities should be given more of a say over their own affairs, not less. 'I therefore intend to keep the effectiveness of the new park under review, in particular the accountability arrangements, to ensure that communities retain local control over decisions affecting their own area. 'There is no gua

1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
725	negative	How can David Cameron talk about fairness when he is still committed to a tax cut for millionaire's estates, won't back our £1.2bn help for the unemployed to get back into work, and wants to cut Sure Start?
328	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.

236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
1066	positive	This is very important. We are talking about the Airbus of the car industry. The Government cannot afford this brinkmanship. GM Europe has just a month of money left.
16	negative	This confirms the widely held suspicions that leading officials and political advisers close to Tony Blair were deliberately tweaking the presentation of the intelligence to bolster the case for war on Iraq.
254	neutral	We've sanctioned low-level contacts with them so that we can make absolutely clear our determination to see UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the disbanding of militias among other things in Lebanon, taken forward with real speed,
316	neutral	Is patriotism something you like only when it is brandished by Barack Obama?

999	neutral	It was first brought up by Vilas Muttamwar and seconded by Vilasrao Deshmukh on Saturday at the Aurangabad convention. The overriding sentiment of the party leaders was that all goodwill gestures by the Congress were being taken as signs of weakness by the NCP. The issue is now in the domain of the party high command. Deliberations are on and a decision (about the alliance) is expected soon,
1239	neutral	We will now contest in 28 out of 40 seats in Bihar as per our seat sharing pact with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). We will work to defeat communal forces,

336	neutral	Eastern Congo has been mired in conflict since Rwanda's genocide nearly 15 years ago spilled war across the border and Hutu militias sought refuge here. Nkunda contends he was defending the region's minority Tutsis against the Rwandan Hutus. In a rare move by former enemies, Congolese and Rwandan forces drove out about 600 of the Hutu militias fighters earlier this year and the Congolese army hoped to force out 400 more by the end of March, said Kudura Kasongo, the Congolese presidential spokesman.

544	neutral	If the Dalai Lama doesn't come, I'm not going ... I'm very disappointed,

255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
