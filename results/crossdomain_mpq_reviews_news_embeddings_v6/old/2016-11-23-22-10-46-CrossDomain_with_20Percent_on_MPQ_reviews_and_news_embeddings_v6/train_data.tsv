It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.

1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
725	negative	How can David Cameron talk about fairness when he is still committed to a tax cut for millionaire's estates, won't back our £1.2bn help for the unemployed to get back into work, and wants to cut Sure Start?
328	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.

236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
1066	positive	This is very important. We are talking about the Airbus of the car industry. The Government cannot afford this brinkmanship. GM Europe has just a month of money left.
16	negative	This confirms the widely held suspicions that leading officials and political advisers close to Tony Blair were deliberately tweaking the presentation of the intelligence to bolster the case for war on Iraq.
254	neutral	We've sanctioned low-level contacts with them so that we can make absolutely clear our determination to see UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the disbanding of militias among other things in Lebanon, taken forward with real speed,
463	positive	No western invader in Afghanistan was successful in establishing their control in the country for long. After the British and the Russians, now it is the turn of the US.

316	neutral	Is patriotism something you like only when it is brandished by Barack Obama?
1073	positive	It seems the IRS and Treasury Department went out of their way to knock out an emerging, effective and evenhanded way to collect tax debt that the IRS will otherwise never collect,

1164	neutral	I was expecting Contador's attack in this stage,
999	neutral	It was first brought up by Vilas Muttamwar and seconded by Vilasrao Deshmukh on Saturday at the Aurangabad convention. The overriding sentiment of the party leaders was that all goodwill gestures by the Congress were being taken as signs of weakness by the NCP. The issue is now in the domain of the party high command. Deliberations are on and a decision (about the alliance) is expected soon,
1239	neutral	We will now contest in 28 out of 40 seats in Bihar as per our seat sharing pact with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). We will work to defeat communal forces,

336	neutral	Eastern Congo has been mired in conflict since Rwanda's genocide nearly 15 years ago spilled war across the border and Hutu militias sought refuge here. Nkunda contends he was defending the region's minority Tutsis against the Rwandan Hutus. In a rare move by former enemies, Congolese and Rwandan forces drove out about 600 of the Hutu militias fighters earlier this year and the Congolese army hoped to force out 400 more by the end of March, said Kudura Kasongo, the Congolese presidential spokesman. But tha

570	neutral	I am happy to announce the alliance. We would campaign together for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections,
1138	neutral	Hamas has presented its demands to the Egyptian mediators, who relayed them to the Israelis. We hope that the Zionist enemy will accept our demands in the coming days.

1472	neutral	This government apparently won't bring back Gilad Shalit,
809	neutral	Hezbollah has no ection to holding contacts with Britain,
1414	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense I do not expect Obama to make any breakthrough negative statement,
544	neutral	If the Dalai Lama doesn't come, I'm not going ... I'm very disappointed,
1416	neutral	The Taleban can't beat us. They don't pose a tactical or strategic threat to Nato and Isaf forces.
162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end ‘dialogue of the deaf,'
255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
522	neutral	The cabinet's position is that we do not want the 2010 World Cup to be used as a platform to advance the political causes of various groups,

426	negative	Once the PKK is eliminated there are no bounds to what is possible: you are our neighbours and kinsmen.

822	neutral	Simulation is not new but I think we did really bring it to Formula One more aggressively than anyone has in the past and hopefully that will give us an advantage this season,
1174	negative	The police do nothing. When we first went to them and told them that spurious liquor was killing people here, they just laughed t us. They said they had all died their natural deaths. Now, we will make sure that this mafia is completely rooted out of this area,
1144	neutral	[Israel] thinks that Hamas will accept less than the bare minimum under pressure that the next Israeli government risks being less disposed to proceed with an exchange,
1133	negative	It worries me and it should also worry Hamas. That is why I would recommend to Hamas to quickly make a deal. They will not get better terms than these,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,
615	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections.

220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists
839	neutral	This is a positive move, which I hope now draws a line under the debate and allows the British Olympic Association to move forward with planning for 2012.
1017	neutral	A little bit of profit-taking and a little bit more reality. Whatever spending plans the Federal Reserve put in place will take half a year at least to seep through,
369	negative	Blair . . . has replied to my complaint about the idiot Mullin:
1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab

1068	neutral	The Commission starts from the position that a Parliament which reflects the make-up of the nation it represents will result in better legislation and a higher degree of public confidence in the democratic process.
482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1194	negative	Tory plans to raise revenue looked flaky six months ago, but now we are in a recession they look even more like fantasy figures. 'With the Shadow Cabinet clearly confused, it is time that David Cameron came clean on what tax rises or spending cuts he will make to plug the holes in his tax plans.
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission. It is a test of Barroso's courage and conviction. Today should be an important day in the history of international financial markets - but we shall see if the current conservative European Commission is capable of taking the recommended steps.
1572	negative	We live in a democracy but I note from the Standards in Public Office Commission today that it expects everyone to live by the same rules as everyone else and I hope that whatever incomplete information he [Ganley] was able to give so far will be given.

437	neutral	The White House believes those that have committed atrocities should be held accountable,
1205	negative	These recruitment figures show the real priority of the people running the NHS. 'It is shocking that a service which is meant to be about frontline medical care is taking on far more managers and bureaucrats than it is medical staff.
1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,
113	negative	The only difference between [Khodorkovsky] and any other large-scale business at the time was his anti-Kremlin stance,

812	neutral	by William A Fleckenstein that his policy of keeping rates too low for too long inflated the housing bubble. The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

1076	neutral	We've dealt with 85 percent of issues; the other problems will only be resolved once Omar Suleiman returns from Washington,
443	negative	Such parties mainly try to play on rhetoric, but the voter has become intelligent and does tactical voting. The Muslim voter's primary concern is to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power.
398	positive	South Africa concurs with the African Union's initial response that the ICC's decision is regrettable as it will impact negatively on the current peace processes in the Sudan,

1541	neutral	But I was asleep! So he recorded a little answerphone message and Jack (husband Jack Tweed) played it to me,
1071	neutral	Lawrence Summers, Obamas top economic adviser, said. Over the past week, Obama's administration has launched detailed plans to stabilize financial markets, including a huge programme to mop up toxic assets that are at the root of the worsening recession. US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner also signalled to Congress his plans to create more oversight for the non-banking financial industry - hedge funds, private equity firms and derivatives markets - that created shaky investment instruments in the toxic ass

1093	neutral	I wish that the year 1388 be the year of peace, happiness and prosperity for all Afghans. A large pole adorned with colourful flags was then hoisted-a key moment broadcast live on television during which some believe prayers can be answered and miracles happen. Many of the estimated 10,000 people who packed their shrine for the event told AFP they would pray for peace. Others like Ahmad Shah asked for good health or prosperity. I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,
41	positive	It is right [of Mr Brown] to remind Americans that we need to work together against protectionism, in defeating terrorism and in combating climate change.

1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,
