129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .

170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .

274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .

218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .

200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .

287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?

290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.

121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .

184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .

285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .

161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .

164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.

131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.

132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.

193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?

296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
