193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )

247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .

301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .

150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .

285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).

155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.

113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
202_ 1	neutral	cheaper in every way .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
144_ 4	positive	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
247_ 0	neutral	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
182_ 16	positive	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
127_ 6	positive	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
140_ 36	neutral	if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
138_ 4	neutral	one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
140_ 18	neutral	negatives ?
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
123_ 34	neutral	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
VIDEOGAMES_282_10	positive	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
ELECTRONICS_209_2	negative	My T720 has broke down several times.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.

BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
DVDS_191_28	negative	This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.

1178	neutral	Murr opposed the obstruction of the presidential elections. He supported Bkirki and its principles, which were violated. The development of his position led to rapprochement. However, this possibility does not mean that we authorized MP Murr to form alliances in the Metn. His vision of the [electoral] battle in the Metn is different from ours,
800	positive	We have a Department of Justice which is fully capable of doing an investigation,
1285	neutral	UNHCR is also deeply concerned about the continuing conflict between the Nuer and Murle ethnic groups in the Jonglei region that has so far claimed the lives of some 750 people and caused significant displacement,

1187	neutral	The law firm of Orum&Roth LLC is engaged in a campaign to notify potential infringers about Card Activation's patent. Notifying a party about the existence of the patent is the first step in attempting to obtain a license agreement. The firm is also engaged in performing due diligence to determine the method used by each potential infringer and to document that method. The firm then generally engages in communications about the patent either directly with a party or with that party's outside counsel. Th

1072	neutral	It is a very pragmatic country and while it may be arguing with the UK about Alexander Litvinenko [the former KGB agent killed in London] it doesn't mean that they won't be closely watching what the government is doing. The Russian government has earmarked $280bn [£200bn] for financial support in the banking system.
1393	neutral	While it is 100 percent an Afghan decision when the elections take place, from a technical point of view, this (date) works for NATO and ISAF (the International Security Assistance Force),
1383	neutral	Today's failed gilt auction should be of real concern to everyone. 'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.
341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,

1530	neutral	If indeed after June we have no more UN or OSCE mission, then Georgia's need (for security) will concentrate on EUMM ...

1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue.

183_ 37	neutral	5.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
208_ 1	neutral	For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
3_ 18	negative	The flash is very weak.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
146_ 0	neutral	I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
189_ 12	neutral	1.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
79_ 8	positive	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.

77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.

189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.

163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.

140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!

137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.

225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
320_ 4	neutral	In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
