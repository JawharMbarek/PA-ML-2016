174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
122_ 1	neutral	why ?
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
213_ 22	negative	it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
229_ 2	positive	price !
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !

290_ 19	neutral	battery :
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .

110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .

173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .

182_ 23	positive	this player is an ideal purchase .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .

Since 2001 when I opened my constituency office in Swansea, I have always had a joint leasing arrangement with Swansea West Labour Party for certain equipment, which is used by both my office and the local party. This equipment has been upgraded as and when they are no longer functional for the job required. All of these costs have been cleared by the National Assembly's Fees Office.

1033	neutral	We expect the ECB to cut interest rates by a further 50 basis points to one percent in April,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February.

627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.

729	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
707	neutral	I have prepared a legal proposal that would explain and clear the Presidential immunity, as it is improperly defined by the Constitution. Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
829	neutral	These statements show the depravity of this man's beliefs. They must incite hatred and encourage terrorism, and I would encourage the Metropolitan Police to investigate them as rigorously as possible.
1322	negative	We submitted a bailout program only a week after the coalition was formed, and it's not the government's fault that the government's anti-crisis program has not been considered and supported by the Verkhovna Rada.
296	positive	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
1339	positive	My intent was not to go after Rush % I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was maybe a little bit inarticulate,
735	negative	The appointment of Dennis Ross, whose track record shows his unacceptable radical viewpoints about Iran, is inconsistent with Mr. Obama's claims about his willingness to create change in Iran-US relations and contains no positive messages for Iran,
1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.
550	neutral	The comments of the minister of health were rather unfortunate in the sense that this position on the Dalai Lama is an official position of this government,

802	negative	The main fault lies with the Interior Ministry that did not submit even fundamental evidence. The NSS´s decision is therefore not a verdict on the Workers´ Party, but a verdict testifying to the Interior Ministry´s and Minister Langer´s incompetence,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.

988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,
517	neutral	That view will be among several positions that will define security requirements for the Soccer World Cup,
1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
437	neutral	The White House believes those that have committed atrocities should be held accountable,
970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008. I urge the Government to focus on this opportunity to provide quick aid to

611	neutral	If you're any of those six at this point, you don't want to go to the twenty-five countries that make up the European Union, because you may be subject to immediate arrest. What will happen next is this investigation will most likely continue in a very vigorous form,

1499	positive	Not all of the member-countries are quite as committed to the idea [of human rights], but the existing traditional Asean spirit of consensus is already a significant progress.

1162	neutral	It is testimony that next time, we should go to something more complete in order to prevent the rearmament of Hamas,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
