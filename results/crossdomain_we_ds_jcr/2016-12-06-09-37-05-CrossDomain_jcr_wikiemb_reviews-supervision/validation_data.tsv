1	neutral	They talked a bit about that (Iraq), and in the end President Obama asked President Bush how he was enjoying his new endeavor and whether they'd moved into the new house. So they talked a couple of minutes about that,
2	neutral	The new U.S. president, who came to office on the slogan of bringing change in the policies of the Bush administration, speaks of unconditional commitment to defend Israel's security,
3	negative	I view reversal of the Bush Administration's 2001 policy as an essential step to maximize the efficiency of bringing embryonic stem cell therapies to the clinic,
4	positive	We're invited to comment on the events of the day and along the way, we remind people that there was, indeed, good news under President Bush,
5	positive	We're invited to comment on the events of the day and along the way, we remind people that there was, indeed, good news under President Bush,
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
7	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
8	negative	If President Obama takes a look at what happened to President Bush, he won't want to,
9	negative	After the partisan and divisive approach that President Bush took with judicial nominations, I appreciate President Obama's seriousness in making his selection,
10	neutral	This is the PM who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto,
11	negative	President Bush has left President Obama a hard hand to play: an economy in crisis and a budget in deep deficit, in deficit this year alone by $1.752 trillion,
12	negative	No one should expect a lot of Bush nostalgia on this trip,
13	negative	Some of the policies followed by President Bush have given rise to a lot of anti-American feeling in Pakistan,
14	negative	All parts of the Labour party, from Tony Blair, the parliamentary Labour party, constituents and unions, agreed in 2004 that the Royal Mail would continue to belong to the people, and this pledge was included in the election manifesto ... in 2005.
15	positive	This was a great meeting where we discussed the key issues surrounding climate change policy with international leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who have already gained valuable insight on how such policies may affect manufacturing and economic opportunities,
16	negative	This confirms the widely held suspicions that leading officials and political advisers close to Tony Blair were deliberately tweaking the presentation of the intelligence to bolster the case for war on Iraq.
17	positive	I accept with pleasure the invitation from my friend Berlusconi... now that a spirit of friendship and cooperation prevails,
18	neutral	Chairman Kerry plans to hold a confirmation hearing for Assistant Secretary Hill as soon as possible, at which all views and concerns that senators may have can be aired,
19	neutral	When I came out of maternity leave, I met Nicolas Sarkozy and we talked about my future. He convinced me that political involvement exists in different forms,
20	neutral	It is now of course up to the French parliament to state its position, but the president (Sarkozy) has clearly indicated that the process that should lead France to resume its full place (in NATO) has reached its final stage,
21	neutral	Nicolas Sarkozy and (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel let it be known that France and Germany would not agree to Luxembourg, Austria or Belgium being put on a tax haven list,
22	positive	The secretary-general and Bill Clinton will bring a strong message of hope that Haiti is still winnable,
23	positive	Bill Clinton has a matchless talent for bringing people together and inspiring them to work for a higher purpose,
24	neutral	presents a critical assessment of Sen. Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Sen. Clinton,
25	neutral	The fact that Hillary presents a critical assessment of Senator Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton,
26	positive	This cohesion around the party of the majority, its chairman (Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev... this support is crucial today when the economic crisis is trying to grip Russia,
27	negative	Even in December [President Medvedev] said that Parliament was not working hard enough, that it was only undertaking 30% of the measures set down to tackle the financial crisis. He didn't name Vladimir Putin personally, of course, but still…
28	negative	Even in December [President Medvedev] said that Parliament was not working hard enough, that it was only undertaking 30% of the measures set down to tackle the financial crisis. He didn't name Vladimir Putin personally, of course, but still…
29	negative	As long as Putin and his people control the Kremlin, they'll do everything they can to keep Khodorkovsky in jail for as long as possible,
30	neutral	Because he was voted for as [Putin's] successor, he has to maintain a balance between continuity and his liberal initiatives,
31	neutral	Certainly, the crisis is a problem, but as Prime Minister Putin said, there will be no tragedy,
32	neutral	Former president Mbeki wishes to invite anyone who has such evidence to hand it over to the law enforcement agencies so that legal remedies are sought by any party that believes that it may have been unduly compromised,
33	negative	We are very disappointed with Osama bin Laden's call for fighting in Somalia when we already have a government,
34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.
36	neutral	It's time for Gordon Brown and his colleagues to break the spell Peter seems to have over the higher echelons of Government.
37	positive	These things are normally mostly ceremonial, but Brown's speech to Congress is the biggest single event of the trip,
38	positive	I'm deeply grateful to Her Majesty the Queen and to Prime Minister Brown for this extraordinary honor. I have always prized the opportunity to work with the British government and strengthen and deepen the role of our two countries as leading beacons of democracy in the world,
39	negative	Gordon Brown is deeply implicated in the mistakes of the past. Even if he won't apologise, he can't escape them.
40	negative	Gordon Brown seemed to offer a lot of warm words but very few hard plans to fight the recession which has engulfed the world economy and his government.
41	positive	It is right [of Mr Brown] to remind Americans that we need to work together against protectionism, in defeating terrorism and in combating climate change.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
45	negative	Gordon Brown's speech shows that he is in complete denial about how wrong he has been for 12 years, and his own responsibility for the banking crisis.
46	negative	Bin taxes are now dead in the water. 'This is a major snub for Gordon Brown and his ministers. These unpopular taxes would harm the environment by fuelling fly-tipping and backyard burning, and hike tax bills for struggling families.
47	negative	Last autumn Gordon Brown was boasting about how he masterminded the Lloyds takeover of HBOS and now he's saying it's got nothing to do with him. Macavity is back,
48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
49	negative	Central to Gordon Brown's attempt to draw a political dividing line with the Conservatives in the run up to the Budget, has been his claim that the whole world is signed up to yet more debt-funded fiscal stimulus.
50	neutral	I put the question of this famous black list to Gordon Brown, and he told me that he shared my concern and that everything had to be done to avoid such a situation,
51	negative	Gordon Brown should stop dithering and stop these plans in their tracks.
52	negative	Whilst taxpayers are shelling out for more jobs in the public sector, Gordon Brown is allowing companies to go to the wall,
53	positive	Gordon Brown's message that he wants to see the number of nuclear weapons reduced, that UK numbers are not fixed and that he is ready to work reduce them further, is a significant step towards a safer and eventually nuclear-weapon-free world,
54	negative	Gordon Brown is spending taxpayers' money on the latest digital gimmicks... but can't be bothered to give out a simple email address.
55	positive	I welcome that Gordon Brown reminded us of the
56	negative	When Gordon Brown sits down with the other G20 leaders in London next week, he will have to explain why he, of all the people sitting around the table, has the highest budget deficit.
57	negative	When it comes to plans for a second fiscal stimulus, I say this to Gordon Brown: enough is enough. We will not let you play roulette with the public finances yet again.
58	negative	One of the side-effects of quantitative easing will be a negative impact on pension funds and pensioners. Yet again pensioners are having to pay the price for Gordon Brown's age of irresponsibility.
59	negative	This is a direct result of Gordon Brown's reckless failure to provide enough prison places. Releasing criminals early has already resulted in three murders and over a thousand other crimes. It is unacceptable and Ministers must scrap this policy now.
60	neutral	Ask Mr Zapatero.
61	neutral	We are interested in continuity, stability and legitimacy in the period between the formal end of President Karzai's mandate on May 22 until August 20,
62	negative	There's a great concern about President Karzai,
63	positive	This is a magnificent result for Rajoy. It is going to shut up many (of his critics) and put wind in his sails,
64	negative	If the AK Party falls below 40 percent and loses Istanbul, this will be serious for Erdogan,
65	negative	If the AK Party falls below 40 percent and loses Istanbul, this will be serious for Erdogan,
66	positive	I want to thank His Excellency, the President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe,
67	negative	The message this sends out is that President Mugabe is still supportive of the criminal and lawless behaviour of his officials who want to loot and grab,
68	negative	No, we have given Mr. Mugabe enough time,
70	negative	Like Slobodan Milosevic or Charles Taylor, Omar al-Bashir's destiny is to face justice,
71	neutral	You know the secretary-general (Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) has said recently that Iran should be involved in a regional approach in regard of Afghanistan.
72	neutral	You know the secretary-general (Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) has said recently that Iran should be involved in a regional approach in regard of Afghanistan.
73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.
74	negative	The market was hyped up on hopes that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would dazzle us with a stimulating stimulus plan,
75	negative	The market was hyped up on hopes that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would dazzle us with a stimulating stimulus plan,
76	neutral	At the beginning he (Beckham) was set to train with us for two months and I didn't think about playing him,
77	neutral	We are going ahead with the operations and we are on the right track, but it's not yet official that Beckham will stay at Milan,
78	negative	They [Fox and Calderon] have stirred the hornet's nest, and people in the cartels and the military are getting killed,
79	negative	They [Fox and Calderon] have stirred the hornet's nest, and people in the cartels and the military are getting killed,
80	neutral	I will discuss it with Mandela,
81	negative	The country wants to know from Prime Minster Manmohan Singh about this money that has simply vanished,
82	positive	I have the utmost respect for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. I have faith in Manmohan Singh and I have no problem in the alliance.
83	negative	Manmohan Singh is the prime ministerial candidate of the Congress. He is not the prime ministerial candidate of the UPA.
84	negative	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
86	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
87	negative	who could be weaker than Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister who could not even remove a senior Cabinet minister for not attending a single Cabinet meeting for one full year
88	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
89	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
90	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?
91	neutral	I don't know if there will be more talks with Netanyahu or where they will lead,
92	positive	I have no doubt that with Netanyahu's government here we will have good and positive relations with the Obama administration,
93	neutral	This is a fundamental choice Bibi [Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu] must make - will he go with the Right, or with us? [A national unity government] should give an equal partnership and have diplomatic understandings, otherwise there will be no deal,
95	negative	I am not afraid of Binyamin Netanyahu,
97	negative	I am not afraid of Benjamin Netanyahu. I won't serve as a fig leaf to anyone, and I won't be anyone's dead weight. We will be the counter force that will prevent the formation of a narrow right wing government, and ensure the establishment of a real government that will take care of the Israeli people,
98	neutral	It would probably not be declared directly but Netanyahu's government will respect the idea of the two states,
99	negative	I'm delighted that the environment ministers have basically defied president Barroso and upheld the rights of individual countries to maintain their GMO bans,
100	positive	Through sheer force of will Thatcher carried along with her not only her own government, but that of the United States as well.
101	negative	who stands accused of walking straight into Margaret Thatcher's carefully laid trap. He walked in to an extent, at a speed, and with a lack of restraint that she could not, in her wildest dreams, have hoped for.
102	negative	Whilst in negotiations, Olmert and his government were busy drawing up plans for the devastating assault on Gaza, and approving the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements,
103	negative	Whilst in negotiations, Olmert and his government were busy drawing up plans for the devastating assault on Gaza, and approving the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements,
104	negative	We came here 10 days ago to be a reminder that this window is closing and to bring the matter to a public test. We hoped that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would take advantage of his last days in office to bring Gilad home. Unfortunately, we were wrong,
105	negative	It's been 1,000 days, in which Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who sent you on the mission [during which you were kidnapped], has not been able to find a way to bring you home. We are not even close to that day,
106	positive	Ultimately, history will judge Olmert's three-plus years as prime minister more favorably than is the accepted contemporary analysis,
107	positive	Our recent history in this country is we look for ‘hooks,' people who get you really fired up Ted Kennedy Newt Gingrich Hillary Clinton ,
108	negative	Before it's all over, it'll be called the Ted Kennedy Memorial Health Care bill ,
109	positive	I thought it would be appropriate to play tonight, because no one has done more than Senator Ted Kennedy to help resolve the problems of Ireland,
110	negative	It seemed in the past that the ODS was reluctant to name things with their real names. Only after they came to realise that Klaus has completely betrayed them they are starting doing so,
111	positive	Instead of there being a trial in Moscow of Khodorkovsky, there should be a hearing in Moscow to determine who has been behind the attack and destruction of Yukos,
112	negative	You simply cannot underestimate the importance of the Khodorkovsky case -- this process will show where Russia is going,
113	negative	The only difference between [Khodorkovsky] and any other large-scale business at the time was his anti-Kremlin stance,
114	negative	Lower-income people are very aware of the national debate, and are therefore pretty informed. This election is about whether you think Zuma is a hero or a villain,
115	positive	All these men, like Zuma incidentally, actually were comfortable in their own skin. They were people who knew themselves and their limitations and therefore they were able to make the right judgement calls,
116	neutral	He (Zuma) was very concerned about the situation,
117	negative	My daughter is 18 months old and if you asked me what will happen first -- will she get her pension or will Zuma be prosecuted -- I will say she will get her pension.
118	neutral	Thus, I write to you today to request the same opportunity to address the same congregation that Mr Zuma addressed,
119	neutral	I do not believe that the left has taken over. Those who think so, must look at the ANC statements and the statements of our likely president (Jacob Zuma) and find out if there is likeliness of moving to the left,
120	neutral	In the circumstances the DA requests you not to make any decision to discontinue Mr Zuma's prosecution until such time as it has made its representations,
121	negative	If this is indeed the basis of Zuma's representations, this actually aggravates the case against him,
122	negative	This hit on tax receipts is a real blow to Alastair Darling's budget hopes,
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
124	neutral	The decision was dictated by the Libyan guide (Gaddafi),
125	negative	If the Americans can apply pressure to guarantee compensation for victims, why is our own Government selling short victims from all corners of the United Kingdom who suffered at the hands of the terrorists Gaddafi bank-rolled, armed and trained?
128	negative	I am ready to welcome Tadic as president of Serbia if he agrees to come to the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo,
129	negative	I've never wanted to upset my friend Boris Tadic, but I wish he leaves the stadium upset and myself in high spirits,
132	negative	Mrs. Arroyo got personal with Cory,
133	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.
134	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.
135	neutral	&gt;European Parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee has adopted by a large majority Jean-Luc Dehaene's Report analysing the impact of the Lisbon Treaty on the power equilibrium within the European Union. J ean-Luc Dehaene MEP emphasises that the Lisbon Treaty will lead to important shifts in the competences of the various European institutions. In the future, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union will be on the same footing as regards budgetary powers and legislative work, with c
136	positive	Ferrari was my university and Schumacher was my teacher,
138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,
139	negative	Peres established the reactor in Dimona and developed Israel's nuclear weapons program... In the same way as Pakistan's [nuclear scientist] Dr. Khan, Peres was the man behind the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Africa and other states. He was also behind the nuclear test in South America in 1978.
140	positive	I want to join with Peter. We need to pledge our support to Hugh Orde, to the police services North and South, in their work of combating the activities of these groups.
141	positive	We will leave no stone unturned in making sure that he [Northern Ireland Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde] has available to him all the arrangements necessary to enhance security there.
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
143	neutral	Mervyn King [the Bank Governor] is obviously annoyed that Peter Mandelson is dragging the Bank of England into the argument he's having with Alistair Darling.
144	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
145	neutral	If we don't reach an agreement with Mehmet Ali Talat, who is considered to be a progressive person, I don't know if we will ever reach an agreement,
146	positive	He [Ferguson] has a very good organisation, he thinks one or two steps ahead, about what will happen next year or the year after,
147	neutral	he said. Both parties have maintained that they will not field candidates on strongholds. While the SP won't field candidates in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress will not contest in Mainpuri and Kannauj, the strongholds of Mulayam and son Akhilesh Yadav. SP has also expressed a desire to meet Congress President Sonia Gandhi once again. Meanwhile, Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh told mediapersons in Lucknow that in case the two parties failed to reach an alliance his party was ready to contest
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
149	positive	For them (Third Front) being secular and communal is like changing clothes. A secular government without Sonia Gandhi is next to impossible. And this should not be considered as a sycophancy, it is a harsh fact in the country's politics,
150	neutral	I am ready for the talks (on seat-sharing) if Congress wants. Sonia Gandhi should take a decision in the interest of her party,
151	positive	he did not believe a dignified lady like Gandhi could have any role in the matter
152	neutral	The decision to purchase Cargill continues. We have received on behalf of its representatives the desire of collaborating no matter the decision of the Government and we will come to an agreement so as to continue with the compulsory purchase process announced by the President of the Republic, Hugo Chavez,
153	neutral	I think this a reaction to what happened in the elections last year. Even though Chavez's party did well, it lost the big states,
154	neutral	Michael Jackson phoned her over the weekend but couldn't get through. He wanted to pop in and see her but instead sent her his love and said he was thinking about her.
155	neutral	Eventually he settled on the summer and agreed to work around any shows already booked. Michael Jackson might be the biggest pop star in the world - and these shows are the hottest ticket in town - but not even he can override pre-existing contracts.
156	neutral	Can you believe I got a message from Michael Jackson?
157	neutral	not convinced that the additional evidence provided by Radovan Karadzic [was] sufficient to undermine the extensive evidence supporting the trial chamber's findings
158	neutral	not convinced that the additional evidence provided by Radovan Karadzic [was] sufficient to undermine the extensive evidence supporting the trial chamber's findings
159	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
160	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
161	neutral	I think that Hillary Clinton, when she comes today, will find Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to continue to hold negotiations, not only on economic projects but also political negotiations, a political process,
162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end ‘dialogue of the deaf,'
163	neutral	That is the proposition of the United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton,
164	neutral	presents a critical assessment of Sen. Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Sen. Clinton,
165	neutral	Mrs Clinton's response was very positive,
166	positive	And some of those who played a central role in our peace process are with us today, including your secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and, of course, our dear friend, Senator George Mitchell,
167	negative	Mr. Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second when it opens at the beginning of the next legislative term,
168	neutral	There is no reason to treat Le Pen differently from others, even if we hate his politics.
169	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution,
170	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second,
171	neutral	Every day we receive various information about Ratko Mladic and once we gather enough information we will arrest him,
172	neutral	I've had a substantial discussion with Sergey Lavrov, we ran an ective evaluation of our bilateral ties and agreed on the measures that need to be taken to move on to a new stage in our relationship,
173	neutral	Vice President Biden told President (Fernandez) to transmit the message that President Obama is ready to talk about all issues at the Summit of the Americas, without exception,

178	negative	Once again, Assad contradicts his own statements. Just recently he went on record saying that he had been on the verge of signing a treaty with Olmert and that Syria hopes peace talks will continue with the next government,
179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.
180	neutral	At the moment, Merkel has had no recipe for rescuing her party and attracting new voters,
181	neutral	The President had very productive video conferences this week and phone calls with (Germany's) Chancellor Merkel, with (Britain's) Prime Minister Brown, and (France's) President Sarkozy,
182	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,
183	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,
184	neutral	It will be an interesting match against Roddick,
185	positive	John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national greatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and strength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our
186	neutral	He did not bring any message from the authorities. He did not mention about Daw Aung San Suu Kyi,
187	neutral	After Netanyahu and Lieberman settled the future government's guidelines for regional talks, which focus on toppling Hamas' regime and refusing to commit Israel to a two-state solution, Labor has no reason to stay on,
188	negative	This is a personal-political matter on Lieberman's part. He is leading this proposal only to enable the 200,000 Russians who immigrated to Israel and then emigrated to take part in elections and get their vote at the polling station.
189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked. Do you support or oppose these positions?
190	negative	Zardari has given us the go-ahead to talk to Nawaz Sharif, which is a good sign,
191	neutral	The ambassador was trying to get things resolved between Mr Sharif and the government,
193	neutral	I am sure we can work with Nawaz Sharif in strengthening the democratic process,
194	neutral	I came to meet Mr Nawaz Sharif with an olive branch from the government, with a message from President Asif Ali Zardari that the situation demands greater reconciliation because Pakistan faces great challenges,
195	positive	I don't have the slightest doubt that it was Gorbachev and his policy of glasnost and perestroika that opened the gates for the great changes that first took place in our country and then in this part of the continent,
196	neutral	after the results of local council elections in Iraq and the analysis of these results, it was normal to visit Iraq to convey a message from President al-Assad to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Premier Nouri al-Maliki to congratulate the Iraqi people over the results of these elections and to reiterate keenness on the unity and independence of Iraq. He added that what has been said about the concern for unity and independence of Iraq, the constitutional review and national reconciliation, in addition to
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
199	positive	Even though Pak Lah (Badawi) will soon leave the government and I will leave it too, someday, I believe this spirit of togetherness and the partnership that we've built will continue to expand in the future,
200	neutral	I'm sure you know that the congressional purchase of offsets that Speaker Pelosi initiated several years ago has been suspended for the very reason that they can't guarantee that the offsets are really what they appear to be,
201	neutral	Our leader, Nancy Pelosi, has called for us to examine whether there should be a second stimulus package,
202	neutral	President Chissano has briefed us that he is prepared to talk to Kony,
203	neutral	Nothing has changed from what was agreed in Juba. Chissano has briefed us that he would talk to Kony and find it out from him what has changed,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab
205	negative	There have been rumours of a secret Heathrow deal between the Government and BAA, and these revelations will only add to people's justifiable suspicions. 'The questions now are, what did Mandelson and his friend Rudd discuss, were minutes taken, who offered what to whom and what was agreed? The same questions need to be answered about the meetings between Rudd and Lord Adonis.
206	negative	We take note, with concern, of the views and comments of Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.
207	neutral	Russia is interested in this initiative undertaken by Kevin Rudd about setting up the Asia Pacific Community,
208	negative	I am the victim of a lynching organized by the judicial counselor of the government, [Menahem] Mazuz, the police, politicians and the media,
210	neutral	My dream was to get David Coulthard back on the map where he belonged and in some ways I think we all managed that.
211	neutral	I've already tried David Coulthard and another friend with no response and then realised I should ask you.
212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
213	positive	We are commending Sen. Specter for putting American jobs first and opposing card check legislation,
214	neutral	I have heard the rumours about Wenger leaving for the past three years,
215	neutral	People should not read this as a snub. He (Tsvangirai) excused himself,
216	neutral	I was present when Prime Minister Tsvangirai gave the number (US$5 billion), but it was just a number given. There's a document that actually splits the immediate costs over the next 10 months into two amounts of about a billion dollars each,
217	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
218	neutral	Mr. Tsvangirai has other commitments, as far as I know,
219	positive	I am very sorry for Tsvangirai and his family,
220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
221	neutral	I don't have a comment. If they (Tsvangirai and the Ministers of Home Affairs) have spoken at that level I can't comment,
222	neutral	Gagnon said. President José Eduardo dos Santos, in power for 30 years, had announced presidential elections for 2009. However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament. Uncertainty over whether presidential elections will take place in 2009 is not an excuse for letting the problems highlighted by last year's elections go unremedied ,
223	neutral	We cannot understand the timing of this decision. While we are trying to extinguish the fire here with our troops they chose this exact moment to put more oil on the flames by taking a decision to issue an arrest warrant for President Al-Bashir,
224	negative	The law is clear. President al Bashir must appear before the ICC to defend himself. If he refuses to do so, the Sudanese authorities must ensure that he is arrested and surrendered immediately to the ICC,
225	negative	Today's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir is a landmark step towards ending the impunity of war crimes suspects everywhere. It shows that no-one even a sitting head of state is above international law,
226	positive	The indictment of President Al-Bashir is disastrous for all of us Sudanese, government and opposition. It is totally unacceptable and regrettable,
227	neutral	When the issue came up, we said we cannot condemn Gen. Bashir out of hand and we cannot condone what he is alleged to have done. We decided the best thing was to send our own high level team to do the investigations. That is what we are doing,
228	neutral	No one is above the law. If you are charged with a crime, you must stand up and face those charges in a court of law. President Al-Bashir will have the opportunity to do this before the International Criminal Court,
229	neutral	I don't want to condemn Gen. Bashir nor condone impunity. It will be constructive to defer or suspend the ICC indictments on Gen Bashir,
230	neutral	We are closely watching the regional moves, but holding Al-Bashir accountable in The Hague is not negotiable.
231	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
232	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
233	neutral	Sudan is facing a new ring of conspiracy and a flagrant violation of Sudan's sovereignty and blatant intervention in its internal affairs by the warrant against President Omar al-Bashir
234	neutral	There is a clear Arab and African stance that does not accept the way the ICC has handled the issue of President Al-Bashir,
235	negative	The minister of defense (Barak) changes his opinion and positions according to his mood. After he previously said that he would respond to any rocket attacks, he changed his mind following operation cast lead and declined to respond to the Strip's rockets,
236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
237	neutral	It is completely natural for Barak to want to join the Bibi-Lieberman government,
238	positive	They have genuine world-class players and where once they relied on Steven Gerrard there's now Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher. When they beat us at Anfield earlier this season Gerrard and Torres weren't even playing.
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.
240	negative	We have a video footage showing how GERB activists are giving out food products to voters, and a mass fight which breaks out after there are not enough products for everyone. I am going to send this footage together with a martenitsa to Wilfried Martens (the President of the European People's Party of which GERB is a member), who recently declared his support for GERB, in order to show him how they do elections in Bulgaria
241	neutral	I remain gravely concerned about Gaza, and about where we stand in the search for an independent Palestinian State. The people of Gaza are suffering, and the situation at the crossings is intolerable. The way forward is a durable ceasefire, open crossings, and Palestinian reconciliation under President Abbas,
242	neutral	on Turkey becoming an EU member. Brothers and sisters, Bulgarians! What would Turkey's EU membership mean for Europe? I will tell you with facts and numbers. Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.
244	neutral	&gt;People's Party. T he Chairman of the EPP-ED Group, the largest parliamentary group in the European Parliament, Joseph Daul MEP, has congratulated his former colleague. V aldis Dombrovskis has undertaken the challenging task of heading the government at one of the most difficult times when many countries in Europe and elsewhere, Latvia included, are facing new challenges on how to find effective solutions and make difficult decisions to overcome the current economic crisis. I am sure that in his new positio
245	neutral	In 12 weeks' time, the people of Galway, along with people from Malin Head to the Shannon estuary, will cast their ballots to choose the people who will represent them in the European Parliament for the next five years.
246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.
250	neutral	The Ministry of External Affairs is going to take up with the US State Department the issue with the aim of stalling the auction,
252	neutral	has revealed the core challenge to the Security Council and the United Nations as a whole in the next century: to forge unity behind the principle that massive and systematic violations of human rights - wherever they may take place - should not be allowed to stand.
253	neutral	The Security Council should condemn the fact that an indicted war criminal has deliberately put yet more lives at risk by expelling aid workers,
254	neutral	We've sanctioned low-level contacts with them so that we can make absolutely clear our determination to see UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which calls for the disbanding of militias among other things in Lebanon, taken forward with real speed,
255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
256	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,
257	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,

259	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
260	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,
262	neutral	We intend to raise this violation of the UN Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the UN,
263	neutral	We intend to raise this violation of the Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the U.N.,
264	neutral	We are about to set up a high-level delegation to go to New York to lobby the UN Security Council,

268	neutral	This 90-mile single-track rail line now has only two passing loops on the entire length and Network Rail can give no date for the necessary repairs to the loops at Llandovery, Llandeilo and Knighton.
269	neutral	This 90-mile single-track rail line now has only two passing loops on the entire length and Network Rail can give no date for the necessary repairs to the loops at Llandovery, Llandeilo and Knighton.
270	negative	Network Rail cannot seriously expect us to believe that this work is being deferred to take advantage of more efficient but unknown future methods of delivery when the jobs being cut had already been placed with contractors.
271	neutral	Network Rail seem to be quite confident on the robustness of the tunnel. I think they say it's one of their better tunnels.
272	neutral	(U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon) notes that this is a serious setback to life-saving operations in Darfur and urges the government of Sudan to act urgently to restore those NGOs to their full operational status,
