1128	neutral	No one has asked Hamas or any other faction to recognize Israel or the deals with Washington,
460	negative	Its culture is extermist, is radical, is hostile, denies Israel's right to exist, and it belongs more in the camp of the Taliban and al Qaeda and the Moslem Brotherhoods of the world, all of which are very, very uncompromising. What can we do?
279	neutral	Let me finish with a clear message which I will take with me to Washington which I believe all European leaders in Brussels today would agree to and I believe President Obama would agree to too: bold global action, a global grand bargain, is not now just necessary but it is vitally urgent to deal with the challenges of the world economy.

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

I have been following this programme closel

1154	neutral	I am sure that there are Hamas members on the UNRWA payroll and I don't see that as crime,
