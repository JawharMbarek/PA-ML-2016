1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists
