508	neutral	With an Oceania qualifier still outstanding it is quite likely that we will have Samoa in our pool again, which will also be a tough one. For the first time in our World Cup participation since 1995 we will play another African team in the Pool phase, which will be challenging.
736	neutral	I would like to insist in agreement with the president that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the Palestinian Authority,

302	neutral	The co-sponsors of the previous bill were Secretary of State (Hillary) Clinton and now President (Barack) Obama,
827	neutral	The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities,

1200	neutral	Oh no, come on - this is small beer in the NHS budget.
699	neutral	This is the price of New Labour's
368	neutral	Mugabe is going to try to hold onto his man (Gono) as much as he can because I don't think he wants to create an impression that the men and women who have been with him through thick and thin are expendable,

868	neutral	We will reintroduce the National Women Development Policy adopted during the last Awami League government's tenure. We gave nomination to maximum number of women for contesting the December 29 polls,
558	neutral	If the Congress strength in the next Lok Sabha exceeds 130-135, Manmohan Singh will become PM in all probability. If that party's strength is reduced to a number less than 120, a leader of the any of the UPA allies can stake his claim for the top job
1240	neutral	Congressman Jefferson is at present being tried in the USA and Atiku had never been indicted on the matter,
839	neutral	This is a positive move, which I hope now draws a line under the debate and allows the British Olympic Association to move forward with planning for 2012.

1304	neutral	At the start of the day I ordered the closure of AngloGold Ashanti,
1467	positive	Just as the State of Israel is committed all the way to bringing back a captive soldier and locating a missing fighter, this is what we are doing these days to speed up the return of Gilad Shalit, national commitment is strong before you and your loved ones,

425	positive	I believe the PKK will accept the wish of all Kurdish parties, laying down its arms and putting an end to violent action,
627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
1552	neutral	The oil markets are entering the second quarter, proverbially a time when US and OECD crude inventories build, with stockpiles already at highs more commonly seen, if at all, towards the end of that process,
468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,
333	negative	Today's decision in the Bank of America case is a victory for taxpayers. Let the sun shine in. Justice Fried's decision will now lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding the $3.6 billion in premature bonuses Merrill Lynch rushed out in early December,

729	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
707	neutral	I have prepared a legal proposal that would explain and clear the Presidential immunity, as it is improperly defined by the Constitution. Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

1115	neutral	Expanding the opening of the crossings to non-humanitarian aid is conditional on Hamas releasing Gilad Shalit,
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
296	positive	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
1339	positive	My intent was not to go after Rush % I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was maybe a little bit inarticulate,
1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.

802	negative	The main fault lies with the Interior Ministry that did not submit even fundamental evidence. The NSS´s decision is therefore not a verdict on the Workers´ Party, but a verdict testifying to the Interior Ministry´s and Minister Langer´s incompetence,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
1358	neutral	Neither Microsoft nor [Microsoft PR agency] Burson-Marsteller has ever paid money to either Privacy International or 80/20 Thinking, nor has any benefit in kind been given,

867	neutral	I do not know whether COAS General Kayani persuaded President Asif Ali Zardari to restore the judges, but I am sure some people must have persuaded him.
1469	positive	This government must not clear its table before Shalit is back home,
1022	negative	The Common Agricultural Policy in its current form doesn't serve the best interests of the farming industry or consumers across Europe, which is why we've consistently pushed for far-reaching reform.
