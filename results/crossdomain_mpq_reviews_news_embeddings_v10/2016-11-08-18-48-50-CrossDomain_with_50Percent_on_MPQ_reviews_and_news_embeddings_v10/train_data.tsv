1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,

970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008.

590	neutral	Today I issue a call that responsibility must also fall on the European Union.

1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.

697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,
383	neutral	A foreign element was almost certainly involved. It could be India, Afghanistan, the Tamil Tigers,

162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end ‘dialogue of the deaf,'
964	neutral	We examined the monastery and other ects. The impression is that there will be a lot of work to do here. We think that the volume of work is comparable to the restoration of the Kremlin or the construction of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral,
81	negative	The country wants to know from Prime Minster Manmohan Singh about this money that has simply vanished,
621	negative	This breathtaking gaffe by Alan Johnson is another example of Labour's cavalier attitude to taxpayers
978	neutral	That has always been the Green Party position before entering government and that is still our position,
776	neutral	We must do our utmost to bringing internet technologies to all citizens of Europe. Internet technologies contribute to half of productivity growth in the EU, and the EU's Member States cannot afford their rural areas missing out on this potential, especially not in these times of economic crisis,
1418	neutral	NATO is no longer the organisation some people speak of. Forty years ago, General de Gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation, an organisation erected against the Warsaw pact and led exclusively by the United States,

15	positive	This was a great meeting where we discussed the key issues surrounding climate change policy with international leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who have already gained valuable insight on how such policies may affect manufacturing and economic opportunities,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,

242	neutral	on Turkey becoming an EU member. Brothers and sisters, Bulgarians! What would Turkey's EU membership mean for Europe? I will tell you with facts and numbers. Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi

175	neutral	Bashar Assad has gradually reduced much of the influence of the old guard without ever having to confront them,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances

255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
603	neutral	By extending this facility to Pakistan, the European Union would be helping itself also,

462	neutral	Debriefings of Al Qaeda leaders arrested confirmed this,
1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training. It will also threaten the care that patients receive because there will not be the same continuity of care and because smaller surgical teams will have to be shut down.

123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
