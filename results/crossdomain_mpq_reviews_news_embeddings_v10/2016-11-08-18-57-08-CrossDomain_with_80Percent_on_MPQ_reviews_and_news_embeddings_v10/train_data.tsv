1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more. Isn't this a direct admission that people who vote for BSP and DPS cannot ever read the ballots?

930	neutral	There had been no talk with the Congress party regarding any seat sharing arrangement. What we can say right now is that the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) cannot form the government at the centre once again without Samajwadi Party support.
1218	positive	We also welcome the increased focus on supporting the Afghan National Security Forces to almost double in size and also the issue of focus on development for both Afghanistan and Pakistan,

1383	neutral	Today's failed gilt auction should be of real concern to everyone. 'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.

467	negative	I certainly support the president keeping the American people safe from Al Qaeda,
1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
105	negative	It's been 1,000 days, in which Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who sent you on the mission [during which you were kidnapped], has not been able to find a way to bring you home. We are not even close to that day,
1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,

255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
227	neutral	When the issue came up, we said we cannot condemn Gen. Bashir out of hand and we cannot condone what he is alleged to have done. We decided the best thing was to send our own high level team to do the investigations. That is what we are doing,

327	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.
230	neutral	We are closely watching the regional moves, but holding Al-Bashir accountable in The Hague is not negotiable.
668	negative	Sadly, every week we see businesses down-sizing and others going to the wall and more people losing their jobs. What we need is real leadership from James Purnell (Work and Pensions Secretary) and this tired Labour Government.
674	neutral	We could have been Governor of Canada living in Ottawa in the Government House,
613	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections.

350	neutral	The crude oil market is watching two fronts: the stock markets and the dollar, (and) right now crude prices are up as Wall Street is gaining,

1286	neutral	&gt;United Nations has said, calling for better management to alleviate water shortages. Population growth and mobility, as well as increased energy production, especially of biofuels such as ethanol, are contributing to the high demand for water, UNESCO said Monday, the first day of a global water forum in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city. With increasing shortages, good governance is more than ever essential for water management. Combating poverty also depends on our ability to invest in this resource,

1197	neutral	Policy is that servicemen have a priority within the NHS and I hope NHS managers remind themselves of that.
681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition. The Labor Party is perceived as the party that started the peace process, the Oslo process. Once they are on board it is much easier to convince the international community that this government is not a radical-right government,

One, player's availability during each phase of the tournament; two, flexibility in selection of playing squad during the phases; and three, the fact that Dravid will not be available due to personal reasons for the entire tournament,
1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training. It will also threaten the care that patients receive because there will not be the same continuity of care and because smaller surgical teams will have to be shut down.
655	neutral	If we had taken the decision to allow LIAT to simply fold, the fact is that Caribbean Star... would have been subject to the decision of the US Supreme Court, there would have been a receiver, the assets would have been frozen... we would have had a real problem, a crisis, genuine crisis,
104	negative	We came here 10 days ago to be a reminder that this window is closing and to bring the matter to a public test. We hoped that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would take advantage of his last days in office to bring Gilad home. Unfortunately, we were wrong,
427	negative	the PKK must become involved in political and parliamentary life instead of resorting to weapons, since using guns does wrong to Kurds and Iraqis

724	negative	This is hypocrisy from David Cameron % not that long ago his policy commission was actively pushing for the complete deregulation of the mortgage market.
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February.

651	neutral	The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal by the state against the High Court decision to grant him bail,
409	neutral	Low carbon growth is the only growth story, because high carbon growth would eventually choke itself off.

1121	neutral	Hamas has no veto on presidential and parliamentary elections despite our large majority at the parliament,

212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,
611	neutral	If you're any of those six at this point, you don't want to go to the twenty-five countries that make up the European Union, because you may be subject to immediate arrest. What will happen next is this investigation will most likely continue in a very vigorous form,
1123	negative	If it turns out that Hamas has not got the message, it will be hit again,
982	neutral	If it is suggested -- as I believe that it is -- that I was involved in any conversations, the ective of which was to manipulate the National Prosecuting Authority or use it as a tool to frustrate Zuma's ambition to occupy the highest office in the land by prosecuting him, I am confident that, if any authentic record of my conversations with whomsoever is produced, no evidence would be found that would implicate me in such a conspiracy,
784	neutral	Without enough good quality water our economies and societies can neither thrive nor survive. Europeans realise the seriousness of the issue and they understand that action is needed to maintain clean and sufficient water resources for the survival of our society.

445	neutral	I firmly believe that voting along with Communists and the Social Democrats against the government is such an argument in favour of the end of their party membership that no one can question,
772	neutral	Last year, we lent Poland 2.8 billion euro, which means that by far Poland is the main beneficiary of EIB lending among the new member states and we intend to increase these figures this year. Certainly this year we will lend Poland between 3.5 and 4 billion euro, both in direct lending and also in lending to Polish banks.
1416	neutral	The Taleban can't beat us. They don't pose a tactical or strategic threat to Nato and Isaf forces.
464	negative	Terrorist activities of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other extremists are constantly mounting and undermining the basics of the Afghan statehood and impeding stabilization and restoration.
