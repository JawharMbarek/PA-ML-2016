697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust.

984	neutral	The transfer of authority from elected local councils to a new quango, which will make more planning decisions than in any other National Park, is a step in precisely the wrong direction at a time when local communities should be given more of a say over their own affairs, not less. 'I therefore intend to keep the effectiveness of the new park under review, in particular the accountability arrangements, to ensure that communities retain local control over decisions affecting their own area. 'There is no gua
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,

63	positive	This is a magnificent result for Rajoy. It is going to shut up many (of his critics) and put wind in his sails,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February. On the one hand, the ministry needed to pay out its outstanding debt to business operators, the now famous 2 billion euros, and then it needed to offset the almost 7?percent deficit in the revenue projected and revenue collected,

44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.

189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked.

442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
1	neutral	They talked a bit about that (Iraq), and in the end President Obama asked President Bush how he was enjoying his new endeavor and whether they'd moved into the new house. So they talked a couple of minutes about that,

1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,
1066	positive	This is very important. We are talking about the Airbus of the car industry. The Government cannot afford this brinkmanship. GM Europe has just a month of money left.
627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training.

A New York Police Department official said two women and a man were arrested on charges of inciting to riot and disorderly conduct. It is so important to me to redefine beauty and make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to pursue their dream,
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular.

The firm then generally engages in communications about the patent either directly with a party or with that party's outside counsel. Th

996	neutral	If we really want consumers to buy green, the sustainable choice must be an easy choice. Product information must be clear, and sustainable products must not be a luxury option. European retailers are in a unique position to help us get there. They are a part of consumers' everyday life and can have an immediate impact on the choices they make. That is why I am truly happy to launch the Forum today, alongside Commissioner Dimas. And I believe this is a good starting point for a concerted approach among reta
