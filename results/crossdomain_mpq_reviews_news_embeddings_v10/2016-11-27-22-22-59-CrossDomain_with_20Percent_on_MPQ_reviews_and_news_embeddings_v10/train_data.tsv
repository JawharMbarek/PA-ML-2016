339	negative	We are left to look back and say that Wagoner's appointment as both chairman and CEO in 2003 was little more than an act to ensure the dynasty of GM boardroom arrogance and failure continued,

The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

1093	neutral	I wish that the year 1388 be the year of peace, happiness and prosperity for all Afghans. A large pole adorned with colourful flags was then hoisted-a key moment broadcast live on television during which some believe prayers can be answered and miracles happen. Many of the estimated 10,000 people who packed their shrine for the event told AFP they would pray for peace. Others like Ahmad Shah asked for good health or prosperity. I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,

469	neutral	If the process of integrating . . . members into the state security services and other institutions is frustrated, as it looks very much it will be, then this will leave a huge opportunity for Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has been down but never out, to get back into the game,
758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule. These are complex, sophisticated warships and where problems arose in the early stages MOD gripped the issue, renegotiated contracts where required and got the programme on track - the first of these impressive destroyers, HMS Daring, sailed into Portsmouth, her future base port in January this year.

1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

887	neutral	I arrived at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, which is an 18-story building in Harare,

487	neutral	The European Commission wants the end of the technical negotiations in 2009. When ratification is concerned, there are various estimates. The Commission does not want to state a date
681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition. The Labor Party is perceived as the party that started the peace process, the Oslo process. Once they are on board it is much easier to convince the international community that this government is not a radical-right government,
34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.

236	negative	We must inform you that you cannot count on our support regarding any agreement that you may reach with Ehud Barak.
374	neutral	With South Africa having just concluded its Human Rights Day celebrations, it beggars belief that our government would go out of its way to block the Dalai Lama -- an apostle of peace, who is revered throughout the world for his unwavering commitment to non-violence, human rights and cultural freedom -- from entering the country,
429	negative	I calmed him down and told him not to worry, Begin would get it in the end, because even his opposition wants peace more than him. He was in tears,
1279	neutral	It's tough out there. It's U.S. Open conditions,

1441	positive	the problem of Afghanistan cannot be resolved in one day. That's why we need a permanent table for consultations between NATO, Russia and those nations contributing to stabilization in the medium-term.
666	positive	Its main purpose is to emphasize the inextricable links with our homeland, with the colossal riches created by our ancestors which we are now responsible for.

1056	neutral	If Poland is ready to sign such an arrangement, Gazprom will deliver the gas,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,

558	neutral	If the Congress strength in the next Lok Sabha exceeds 130-135, Manmohan Singh will become PM in all probability. If that party's strength is reduced to a number less than 120, a leader of the any of the UPA allies can stake his claim for the top job

He was addressing the Wharton Global Alumni Forum - organized by the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the world's first collegiate business school - being held for the first time in the Middle East in Dubai.

530	negative	This was a make or break fight for Amir Khan. I felt so completely easy, catching him with jabs. I felt like I was on a better level than him.
37	positive	These things are normally mostly ceremonial, but Brown's speech to Congress is the biggest single event of the trip,
852	neutral	The persecution of the opposition is beginning, and I'm sure that Rosales won't be the last to go to jail,
527	neutral	There is an urgent need and we must prioritise domestic gas supply over any other project, since the country needs power to realise the seven-point agenda of the Federal Government,
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
876	neutral	and sparked panic. Witnesses told WINS radio that the situation was compounded when a man leapt from a car and began grabbing women's purses. A New York Police Department official said two women and a man were arrested on charges of inciting to riot and disorderly conduct. It is so important to me to redefine beauty and make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to pursue their dream,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
149	positive	For them (Third Front) being secular and communal is like changing clothes. A secular government without Sonia Gandhi is next to impossible. And this should not be considered as a sycophancy, it is a harsh fact in the country's politics,
81	negative	The country wants to know from Prime Minster Manmohan Singh about this money that has simply vanished,

314	neutral	I heard from the president (Obama) that he wanted to improve relations with Russia,
607	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
935	neutral	We want to be in at the end of all three competitions; Bundesliga, Champions League and DFB Cup. The boys are hungry for this game,
1385	neutral	We are going to get some more commentary out of Geithner and maybe some more detail on the bank rescue so we'll see if that helps or if it hurts,
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.
669	neutral	This doesn't mean opening up for Lukashenka's sake or for the sake of other personalities, but opening up for the people [of Belarus], to show them, from Brussels, that we are open to dialogue with the Belarusian people,
586	neutral	It is an obligation for our all our states to guarantee harmonised reception procedures throughout the European Union and for this reason the European Parliament has asked for a review of the mandate of Frontex, which should be to ensure the protection of the most vulnerable people and, in particular, of potential refugees
540	neutral	The South African government has not extended any invitation to the Dalai Lama to come to South Africa.

541	neutral	It is true that South Africa, under intense pressure from the Chinese authorities, have denied a visa to the Dalai Lama,
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
729	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
39	negative	Gordon Brown is deeply implicated in the mistakes of the past. Even if he won't apologise, he can't escape them.
1007	positive	As far as I am concerned the National Anthem should stay exactly as it is, which is fine. 'Secondly, those lines are so utterly banal that even an 11-year-old would disown them. 'I am perfectly happy to be British and perfectly happy with the National Anthem as it is. I certainly don't aspire to rewrite anything.
326	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,

1176	positive	There are perhaps 10, 20 (fighters) still left in the mountains. But hundreds of thousands of people celebrated Mohammed's birthday today,
1180	neutral	&gt;European Parliament, Joseph Daul MEP, reiterated his confidence in his political family, the most influential in Europe, its Bulgarian sister parties, and particularly the Leader of the GERB Party and Mayor of Sofia, Boyko Borissov. W ith our Bulgarian friends, we wanted to focus this meeting on responsibility and stability in the economic field.

816	neutral	Real Madrid? Whatever will happen, will happen,
296	positive	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,

636	neutral	Our biggest problem at the moment is who is going to give us money. If the money is available who should it be given to, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Ministry of Finance? Should it be given to commercial banks or someone else?

1495	positive	The ASEAN-Korea Centre will contribute to deepening mutual understanding and thus forging even closer ties between ASEAN and Korea by accelerating trade and investment, invigorating tourism, and enriching cultural exchanges.
1245	neutral	We will continue to be surprised on the bearish side by the data that's coming out - this keeps the demand deterioration argument very much alive, and pushes the OPEC production cuts to the backburner, precluding OPEC from becoming a significant force in this market,
539	positive	Our generation has so much to take on our shoulders when His Holiness passes. The Dalai Lama has unified the hearts of all Tibetans,

432	neutral	A gas pipeline is groundwork for our economy. It will link our countries more closely than the Trasncaucasian Highway.

837	neutral	&gt;Varun Gandhi, great-grandson of India's first premier Jawaharlal Nehru, has been detained in Uttar Pradesh state for whipping up religious hatred in an allegedly anti-Muslim speech he made on the campaign trail earlier this month. Police said more charges had been filed against him because he reported to the po lice station on Saturday accompanied by wild crowds of pro-Hindu supporters who threw stones at officers in a series of violent clashes.
