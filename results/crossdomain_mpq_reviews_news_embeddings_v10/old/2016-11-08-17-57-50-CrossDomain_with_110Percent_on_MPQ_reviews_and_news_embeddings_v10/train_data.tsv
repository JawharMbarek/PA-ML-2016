However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament.

The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008.
