197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension.

He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed

I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.

1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,
