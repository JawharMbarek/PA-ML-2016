1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue.

The firm then generally engages in communications about the patent either directly with a party or with that party's outside counsel. Th

48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
982	neutral	If it is suggested -- as I believe that it is -- that I was involved in any conversations, the ective of which was to manipulate the National Prosecuting Authority or use it as a tool to frustrate Zuma's ambition to occupy the highest office in the land by prosecuting him, I am confident that, if any authentic record of my conversations with whomsoever is produced, no evidence would be found that would implicate me in such a conspiracy,

538	positive	Our generation has so much to take on our shoulders when His Holiness passes. The Dalai Lama has unified the hearts of all Tibetans,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union.

1072	neutral	It is a very pragmatic country and while it may be arguing with the UK about Alexander Litvinenko [the former KGB agent killed in London] it doesn't mean that they won't be closely watching what the government is doing.

198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
