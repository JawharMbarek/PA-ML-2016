214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
229_ 2	positive	price !
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
127_ 0	neutral	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
308_ 5	neutral	...
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
170_ 21	negative	the interface used could be better designed .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
243_ 1	neutral	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
173_ 13	neutral	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
213_ 19	negative	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
274_ 24	neutral	reason ?
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
162_ 28	neutral	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
247_ 5	positive	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
