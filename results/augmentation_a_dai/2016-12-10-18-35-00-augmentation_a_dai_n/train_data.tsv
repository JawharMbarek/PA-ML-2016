213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.

111660997458141184	neutral	Re doing a bio and watching the Republicans debate while smashing some Pineapple sherbet. Not sure what to make of this evening lol
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
146_ 0	neutral	I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
244_ 0	neutral	The title pretty much says it all.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
