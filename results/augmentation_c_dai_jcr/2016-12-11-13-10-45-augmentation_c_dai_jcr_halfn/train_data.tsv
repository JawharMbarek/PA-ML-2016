The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

529	positive	We want to congratulate Brad Pitt for making it right and to hear more about how we can work together so this can be replicated throughout the country.
1017	neutral	A little bit of profit-taking and a little bit more reality. Whatever spending plans the Federal Reserve put in place will take half a year at least to seep through,
1416	neutral	The Taleban can't beat us. They don't pose a tactical or strategic threat to Nato and Isaf forces.
1380	neutral	As the Bank of England is to try quantitative easing, this should, theoretically, encourage banks and building societies to lend more to their customers,
1066	positive	This is very important. We are talking about the Airbus of the car industry. The Government cannot afford this brinkmanship. GM Europe has just a month of money left.

1033	neutral	We expect the ECB to cut interest rates by a further 50 basis points to one percent in April,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February.

425	positive	I believe the PKK will accept the wish of all Kurdish parties, laying down its arms and putting an end to violent action,
627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.

468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,
333	negative	Today's decision in the Bank of America case is a victory for taxpayers. Let the sun shine in. Justice Fried's decision will now lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding the $3.6 billion in premature bonuses Merrill Lynch rushed out in early December,

729	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
707	neutral	I have prepared a legal proposal that would explain and clear the Presidential immunity, as it is improperly defined by the Constitution. Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

1362	positive	I thought it was a great job by Spezza,
1115	neutral	Expanding the opening of the crossings to non-humanitarian aid is conditional on Hamas releasing Gilad Shalit,
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
829	neutral	These statements show the depravity of this man's beliefs. They must incite hatred and encourage terrorism, and I would encourage the Metropolitan Police to investigate them as rigorously as possible.
1322	negative	We submitted a bailout program only a week after the coalition was formed, and it's not the government's fault that the government's anti-crisis program has not been considered and supported by the Verkhovna Rada.
296	positive	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
1339	positive	My intent was not to go after Rush % I have enormous respect for Rush Limbaugh. I was maybe a little bit inarticulate,
735	negative	The appointment of Dennis Ross, whose track record shows his unacceptable radical viewpoints about Iran, is inconsistent with Mr. Obama's claims about his willingness to create change in Iran-US relations and contains no positive messages for Iran,
1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.
550	neutral	The comments of the minister of health were rather unfortunate in the sense that this position on the Dalai Lama is an official position of this government,
545	neutral	We certainly believe South Africa has decided not to give a visa to His Holiness the Dalai Lama under pressure from the Chinese government,
1243	negative	We've been wrestling with OPEC for more than 40 years and we haven't really made any progress reining them in,
1199	positive	All NHS providers will be legally obliged to have regard to the NHS Constitution, which gives patients a legal right to choice.
525	neutral	He makes quite a stable impression. We know that we need him on the way to the 2010 World Cup and afterwards,
301	neutral	It's almost like Barack Obama is using late night to give us all a little hug before we go to sleep at night,

802	negative	The main fault lies with the Interior Ministry that did not submit even fundamental evidence. The NSS´s decision is therefore not a verdict on the Workers´ Party, but a verdict testifying to the Interior Ministry´s and Minister Langer´s incompetence,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.

666	positive	Its main purpose is to emphasize the inextricable links with our homeland, with the colossal riches created by our ancestors which we are now responsible for. The great experience accumulated by the Orthodox Church during many centuries is of great value for the present day generation. This experience inspires and encourages people,
366	negative	If Alex Salmond is defending the Dunfermline building society and the directors, he is really defending the indefensible.
341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,
1290	negative	The costs of badly run NASA projects are paid for with cutbacks or delays in NASA projects that didn't go over budget,
763	negative	If Goodwin is exceptionally to be held to account because his recklessness was so extreme, then he should be stripped of his knighthood since this was granted for
988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,
517	neutral	That view will be among several positions that will define security requirements for the Soccer World Cup,
1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
437	neutral	The White House believes those that have committed atrocities should be held accountable,
970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008. I urge the Government to focus on this opportunity to provide quick aid to

871	neutral	You mustn't expect that this trip will change the position of the Catholic Church towards the problem of AIDS,
326	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,
