391	neutral	When General Motors got its bailout, it required General Motors to renegotiate its labor contracts with the unions. Likewise, the federal government could have required AIG to renegotiate its contracts,
964	neutral	We examined the monastery and other ects. The impression is that there will be a lot of work to do here. We think that the volume of work is comparable to the restoration of the Kremlin or the construction of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral,
455	neutral	She [Paltrow] has a certain public persona that she doesn't suffer fools gladly. Like on a movie set, if the crew is not ready when you call her, she gets incredibly angry,

988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,
730	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
377	neutral	Regional parties want to throw out the national parties. And, the national parties do not want regional parties to occupy national space. This will be there and this will happen in every election. That is why (RJD Chief) Lalu Prasad is saying what he is saying,
1156	neutral	The first round of negotiations ended last week and any time the Israeli enemy is willing to resume talks from the point they stopped, we in Hamas will be ready. The door is still open at this stage to resume the negotiations,

731	positive	England need another batsman to establish himself. Andrew Strauss is good. Alastair Cook is going to be very good. Kevin Pietersen is unbelievable. Paul Collingwood is steady but Owais Shah and Ian Bell have shown only glimpses.
491	neutral	We are looking very carefully at the implications of this decision for the WTO case,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,
452	positive	I extend my condolences to the Fatah party and the Palestinian national authority. Fatah has always sacrificed its prominent members, for the Palestinian cause,

758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule. These are complex, sophisticated warships and where problems arose in the early stages MOD gripped the issue, renegotiated contracts where required and got the programme on track - the first of these impressive destroyers, HMS Daring, sailed into Portsmouth, her future base port in January this year. I have been following this programme closel
613	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,
508	neutral	With an Oceania qualifier still outstanding it is quite likely that we will have Samoa in our pool again, which will also be a tough one. For the first time in our World Cup participation since 1995 we will play another African team in the Pool phase, which will be challenging.

295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
441	neutral	To have a successful presidency, the social life of the White House has to match the times. That's when it becomes such an added benefit to the presidency. It happened in its greatest form with the Kennedys,

1545	negative	When it comes to the banks squandering their customers' money ... I have discovered that it wasn't only Sir Fred who was getting money off RBS, it was also the right honourable member opposite who got £30,000 off the Royal Bank of Scotland for just two after-dinner speeches.
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,

509	neutral	So far in this group, Bulgaria have drawn all of their three World Cup qualifying matches,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
905	neutral	Fox News Sunday.
344	neutral	The decision on captaincy was taken by keeping into account three considerations. One, player's availability during each phase of the tournament; two, flexibility in selection of playing squad during the phases; and three, the fact that Dravid will not be available due to personal reasons for the entire tournament,
997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders. NABIS's specialist CSI-style analysis of ballistics - effectively giving guns and bullets a fingerprint which can be tracked - will help police to match guns to offenders in double quick time.
713	negative	There is only one demand, that's the departure of Ravalomanana,

488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.

785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

467	negative	I certainly support the president keeping the American people safe from Al Qaeda,
887	neutral	I arrived at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, which is an 18-story building in Harare,
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,

773	neutral	We intend to do whatever we can to encourage maximum take up of this exemption by our member states. Micro entities could save as much as €1,200 each year, if member states follow our lead on this one. In the current climate, that is no mean saving,

1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
361	neutral	The reasons that China gives for blocking Coca-Cola should be a test for whether Chinalco should be allowed to invest in Rio Tinto. If you applied the exact same criteria, then Chinalco is out,

395	neutral	He is registered to vote in the constituency which he serves. The Mail on Sunday has suggested he is deliberately concealing the fact that his main residence is in Hammersmith. There is no substance to this allegation.
844	neutral	It [JLP] will be disappointed that profits are down so much, but M&S is going to be way down. John Lewis still has pricing power and is one of the few retailers that has.

589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all.

1516	neutral	If the Government meets the ultimatum of the Alliance for Georgia and calls a referendum, the rest of the opposition will join the initiative.

1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,

Last year's losses were offset partially by $600 million in interest income, giving the bank $19.4 billion in equity at the end of 2008, Moreno told Lugar in a Feb. 11 letter.

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1494	positive	A rights body is not only a campaign on behalf of ASEAN. We are very serious about its establishment, and Indonesia will make sure it sets an example for it. ASEAN is not only about pursuing prosperity, but also democracy, and that includes the rule of law, protection of human rights, and freedom of press. Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,
