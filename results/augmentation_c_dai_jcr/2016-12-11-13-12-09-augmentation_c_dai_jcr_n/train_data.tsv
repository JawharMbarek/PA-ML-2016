509	neutral	So far in this group, Bulgaria have drawn all of their three World Cup qualifying matches,
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting.

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

999	neutral	It was first brought up by Vilas Muttamwar and seconded by Vilasrao Deshmukh on Saturday at the Aurangabad convention. The overriding sentiment of the party leaders was that all goodwill gestures by the Congress were being taken as signs of weakness by the NCP. The issue is now in the domain of the party high command. Deliberations are on and a decision (about the alliance) is expected soon,

1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,
1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
722	neutral	The agreement with the IMF will play a major part in reviving lending. Of the amount we will borrow from the IMF, about two thirds will go to the central bank and less than one third to the Finance Ministry, and, from there, a sum will be distributed to banks, to be used for granting loans,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins. My father is a descendent of the Gaon and the mitnagdim [opponents of Hassidism], and my mother is a descendent of the cousin of the Gaon, who was considered to have betrayed the Gaon.

The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,

305	neutral	I believe that President Obama's message reflects exactly the message that Europeans have been trying to send to Iran.
594	neutral	The European Union of course rejects each act of violence and if a new chef d'etat is established by pure force, military force, or against the constitution, that is not somebody we consider.

1003	neutral	At the moment we are going to take $20 million out of the Medical Fund of the National Insurance Board and use that to fund, initially, the unemployment benefit,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
1139	negative	additional pressure should be exerted, if needed, in order to force Hamas to reach a deal and become more flexible.
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
