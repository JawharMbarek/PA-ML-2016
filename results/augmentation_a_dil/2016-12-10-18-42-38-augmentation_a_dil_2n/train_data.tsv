1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
215_ 39	neutral	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
204_ 7	neutral	solution ?
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
246_ 1	positive	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
231_ 21	negative	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
207_ 4	neutral	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
305_ 6	neutral	now i can always be in contact .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
224_ 47	neutral	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
200_ 19	neutral	if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
161_ 2	positive	way less expensive than the ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
229_ 2	positive	price !
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
173_ 56	neutral	software :
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
184_ 5	positive	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
224_ 7	neutral	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .

239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .

116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
227_ 40	neutral	cons :

149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars

186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
222_ 12	negative	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .

247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .

187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
208_ 40	neutral	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !

131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
308_ 5	neutral	...
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
170_ 21	negative	the interface used could be better designed .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
243_ 1	neutral	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
173_ 13	neutral	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
ELECTRONICS_227_6	positive	Truly fantastic pictures.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
DVDS_176_3	negative	I was extremely disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
DVDS_191_28	negative	This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.

318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.

136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.

325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.

22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.

91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.

243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
106_ 5	neutral	And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
186_ 3	neutral	I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.

132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!

277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.

267_ 7	positive	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.

281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!

122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.

100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.

132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
315_ 1	positive	No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
230_ 1	negative	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.

125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
143_ 6	neutral	I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,

15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.

233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.

166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .

318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.

187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.

185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.

71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.

28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
45_ 1	neutral	With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be

205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.

91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.

153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.

36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.

202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.

243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.

132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.

174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.

15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.

0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
108_ 3	positive	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
190_ 16	negative	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
187_ 13	positive	The hardcase they give with it must work well.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
191_ 24	positive	I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
132_ 178	neutral	 The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
128_ 7	negative	The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
195_ 38	neutral	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
211_ 9	positive	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
233_ 18	positive	4. The Build is just right.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
250_ 10	neutral	All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
183_ 42	neutral	6.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
191_ 16	positive	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
36_ 16	positive	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
122_ 10	neutral	The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
132_ 523	neutral	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
142_ 9	neutral	Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
311_ 12	neutral	A security software suite with lots of value
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
186_ 10	neutral	I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
320_ 4	neutral	In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
144_ 9	positive	In addition it is very easy to setup.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
178_ 10	neutral	Somehow the adap
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
32_ 16	neutral	Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
122_ 1	negative	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
209_ 26	neutral	3.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
189_ 25	neutral	3.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
205_ 7	positive	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
244_ 0	neutral	The title pretty much says it all.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
195_ 41	positive	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
208_ 1	neutral	For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
146_ 0	neutral	I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
79_ 8	positive	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
0_ 7	neutral	I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
183_ 38	neutral	) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
268_ 31	positive	All in all, this is a great phone.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
102_ 0	neutral	I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
154_ 9	positive	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
59_ 1	negative	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.

132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
47_ 0	neutral	I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
188_ 9	positive	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
211_ 11	neutral	m.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
179_ 11	neutral	) as opposed to "gateway", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
132_ 79	negative	 The interface took a little getting used to.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
0_ 86	positive	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
7_ 0	neutral	I have used many digital cameras.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
248_ 8	negative	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
183_ 5	neutral	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
136_ 31	neutral	They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
136_ 33	neutral	Follow the directions exactly.
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
223_ 5	neutral	I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
119_ 7	positive	You just can't go wrong with this one!
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
83_ 6	positive	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
0_ 69	neutral	But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.

193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
250_ 13	neutral	You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
