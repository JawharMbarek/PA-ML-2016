488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
