729	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
707	neutral	I have prepared a legal proposal that would explain and clear the Presidential immunity, as it is improperly defined by the Constitution. Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.

488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
