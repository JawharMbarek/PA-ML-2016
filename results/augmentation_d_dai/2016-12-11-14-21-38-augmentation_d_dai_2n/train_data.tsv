187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;

191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .

146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .

121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.

DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.

MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.

VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.

ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.

212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.

199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.

31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.

266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.

11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!

142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.

307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!

132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.

194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!

36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.

132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.

297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.

132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
