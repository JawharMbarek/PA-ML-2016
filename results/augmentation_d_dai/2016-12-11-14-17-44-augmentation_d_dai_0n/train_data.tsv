170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
162_ 28	neutral	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
166_ 12	neutral	likes
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
208_ 40	neutral	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
181_ 0	positive	i just bought this player today and i already love it .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
234_ 10	neutral	thats it .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
238_ 1	neutral	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .

116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
123_ 34	neutral	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .

243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .

301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .

258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .

128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
504	neutral	There is only one country that will host this World Cup and that is South Africa. And yet you find countries like Canada, Australia are more enthusiastic it seems than our own South African population,

576	negative	Víctor Hugo Cárdenas should ask himself what harm he might have caused his neighbors for them to condemn him.
383	neutral	A foreign element was almost certainly involved. It could be India, Afghanistan, the Tamil Tigers,
1178	neutral	Murr opposed the obstruction of the presidential elections. He supported Bkirki and its principles, which were violated. The development of his position led to rapprochement. However, this possibility does not mean that we authorized MP Murr to form alliances in the Metn. His vision of the [electoral] battle in the Metn is different from ours,
1205	negative	These recruitment figures show the real priority of the people running the NHS. 'It is shocking that a service which is meant to be about frontline medical care is taking on far more managers and bureaucrats than it is medical staff.
1041	negative	The party is headed for a vertical split. I'm going to resign from the Rajya Sabha and the party and will contest as an Independent from Banka,
590	neutral	Today I issue a call that responsibility must also fall on the European Union.
1381	negative	We should all be extremely worried that the Bank of England appears to have abandoned its core remit, which is to safeguard the nation against inflation. 'By providing massive monetary stimulus while inflation is still way above the two per cent target, the Bank of England is flying blind. 'Make no mistake, this will most likely mean a massive inflationary problem in years to come. 'This quantitative easing is a giant gamble, a leap in the dark, with taxpayers

582	neutral	If these plans are carried out, we run the risk of looking like a Third World country,
1383	neutral	Today's failed gilt auction should be of real concern to everyone. 'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.
1494	positive	A rights body is not only a campaign on behalf of ASEAN. We are very serious about its establishment, and Indonesia will make sure it sets an example for it. ASEAN is not only about pursuing prosperity, but also democracy, and that includes the rule of law, protection of human rights, and freedom of press. Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,

719	neutral	Everyone associates me with Manchester United, and rightly so,[*]but when it's in you, it's in you. I'm a Geordie, after all. 'I turned it down four years ago. It was the hardest decision. I just felt I had to be loyal to Birmingham at the time. Whether it will come around again, I don't know. 'However, I thoroughly enjoy what I do here.

343	positive	Rick Wagoner has worked for that company for 31 years, and he is a good man. He clearly is a sacrificial lamb,
529	positive	We want to congratulate Brad Pitt for making it right and to hear more about how we can work together so this can be replicated throughout the country.
1484	negative	The truth is that Secretary Geithner didn't inherit the policy of throwing billions of taxpayer dollars at failing companies -- he helped create it,
1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,
397	positive	However, South Africa supported the decision of the African Union to defer the issuing of the warrant of arrest against President Al-Bashir by a year to give the peace processes in the Sudan a chance,
687	positive	Sri Lanka Air Force at all times safeguarded our motherland's unity, dignity and sovereignty in each and every adverse circumstance,
594	neutral	The European Union of course rejects each act of violence and if a new chef d'etat is established by pure force, military force, or against the constitution, that is not somebody we consider.

1433	neutral	More US and NATO soldiers are now killed in Afghanistan. Their tanks are destroyed and even helicopters are shot down,
1426	neutral	As for consensus in Ukrainian society [regarding joining NATO], there won't ever be any consensus. This is confirmed by the present NATO members,
1354	negative	I'm still left without much information about how Microsoft is ensuring American workers are being protected or specifics of its H-1B visa hiring practices,
460	negative	Its culture is extermist, is radical, is hostile, denies Israel's right to exist, and it belongs more in the camp of the Taliban and al Qaeda and the Moslem Brotherhoods of the world, all of which are very, very uncompromising. What can we do?
610	neutral	I have been hearing from the European Union that the priority is diversification...of routes, supplies, sources. But the declaration...would only enhance the dominant role of Ukraine as a transit country.
1418	neutral	NATO is no longer the organisation some people speak of. Forty years ago, General de Gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation, an organisation erected against the Warsaw pact and led exclusively by the United States,
1069	neutral	The commission has received a proposal to extend decommissioning by Bulgaria. The Commission is assessing the proposal. It has not been approved,
338	neutral	Prior to Rod Blagojevich, we had George Ryan, and he's in jail,
1133	negative	It worries me and it should also worry Hamas. That is why I would recommend to Hamas to quickly make a deal. They will not get better terms than these,
569	neutral	The UPA is no longer united ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. It has proved to be an opportunistic alliance, unlike the NDA (National democratic Alliance) which is united and strong,
1166	neutral	That's the value of the assets of Deripaska's companies, minus debt,
1119	neutral	We are not in a hurry. We have already chosen the Hamas leaders who will be represented in the five reconciliation committees. After we finish our consultations we will announce the final names,

1238	neutral	We have been quite comfortable with 3-1 combination. When it comes to three seamers and one spinner, we have part timers who have proved that they can get wickets in Test cricket also. You have Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and Sachin Tendulkar who can bowl if it is turning,

1235	negative	We are ready for the debate. I myself have been asking Stanishev for one. He sent me the invitation at 5pm and now at 8pm I am here outside his office to talk. I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

621	negative	This breathtaking gaffe by Alan Johnson is another example of Labour's cavalier attitude to taxpayers
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
517	neutral	That view will be among several positions that will define security requirements for the Soccer World Cup,
1292	neutral	NASA decided to hold an election to name its new room at the international space station and the clear winner is Stephen Colbert ,
684	neutral	I totally refute these allegations. Since 2001 when I opened my constituency office in Swansea, I have always had a joint leasing arrangement with Swansea West Labour Party for certain equipment, which is used by both my office and the local party. This equipment has been upgraded as and when they are no longer functional for the job required. All of these costs have been cleared by the National Assembly's Fees Office.

795	neutral	The Arab League has dispatched a fact-finding mission of international jurists to investigate Israeli war crimes in Gaza,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,

1187	neutral	The law firm of Orum&Roth LLC is engaged in a campaign to notify potential infringers about Card Activation's patent. Notifying a party about the existence of the patent is the first step in attempting to obtain a license agreement. The firm is also engaged in performing due diligence to determine the method used by each potential infringer and to document that method. The firm then generally engages in communications about the patent either directly with a party or with that party's outside counsel. Th

613	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections.

313	neutral	Is patriotism something you like only when it is brandished by Barack Obama?
306	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.
930	neutral	There had been no talk with the Congress party regarding any seat sharing arrangement. What we can say right now is that the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) cannot form the government at the centre once again without Samajwadi Party support.
1200	neutral	Oh no, come on - this is small beer in the NHS budget.

1278	neutral	The latest rally is rebounding from the most recent lows in mid February when oil has fallen to 34 dollars a barrel, and supported more recently by recovering in equity indices and speculation about further OPEC supply cuts,
1114	negative	I cannot accept the approach of some of Europe's leaders, who view Hamas as the symbol of responsibility and peace, failing to understand that it is a murderous terror organization preventing peace,
1335	negative	It's our desire that the Republicans would work with us and try to be constructive, rather than adopt the philosophy of somebody like Rush Limbaugh, who is praying for failure.
1417	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense, I do not expect Obama to make any...negative statement,
356	positive	Julia Gillard is definitely a heavyweight. She is a formidable politician. She is by far Labor's best parliamentary performer. If you are in debate with Julia you have to be absolutely on your toes. She is almost in the &lt;name id=
668	negative	Sadly, every week we see businesses down-sizing and others going to the wall and more people losing their jobs. What we need is real leadership from James Purnell (Work and Pensions Secretary) and this tired Labour Government.
527	neutral	There is an urgent need and we must prioritise domestic gas supply over any other project, since the country needs power to realise the seven-point agenda of the Federal Government,
1124	negative	We definitely don't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by Hamas and serve Hamas's extremist purposes,
670	positive	What the [International Olympic Committee] has done, what the IOC environmental commission has done and indeed what the Olympic movement has embraced is, for me, a return to the original Olympic spirit,
787	neutral	I trust that the EU member states will deal with this according to the renewed consensus on enlargement, which is the basis of the EU's enlargement policy as decided in December 2006, and subsequently in the European Councils ever since,
800	positive	We have a Department of Justice which is fully capable of doing an investigation,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins. My father is a descendent of the Gaon and the mitnagdim [opponents of Hassidism], and my mother is a descendent of the cousin of the Gaon, who was considered to have betrayed the Gaon.
459	negative	Al-Qaeda is conducting attacks with no planning and no clear goals,

611	neutral	If you're any of those six at this point, you don't want to go to the twenty-five countries that make up the European Union, because you may be subject to immediate arrest. What will happen next is this investigation will most likely continue in a very vigorous form,
1467	positive	Just as the State of Israel is committed all the way to bringing back a captive soldier and locating a missing fighter, this is what we are doing these days to speed up the return of Gilad Shalit, national commitment is strong before you and your loved ones,

536	negative	The Dalai Lama has not served the religious harmony but instead repeatedly makes troubles,
1457	positive	This is a dream come true for 11 of our member countries. It will surely help to lift the bar of football in these countries. My sincere hope is that the governments and business organisations join with us in this FIFA initiative that will take the sport to even greater heights
739	neutral	We will always support the resistance and its policies and we call on the Palestinian Authority to adopt the path of revolution rather than that of tyranny and monopoly so that it can regain its role as a representative of the Palestinian people,
464	negative	Terrorist activities of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other extremists are constantly mounting and undermining the basics of the Afghan statehood and impeding stabilization and restoration. Specific concern is caused by the fact that terrorists actually control several regions of Afghanistan and form parallel bodies of authority there,
303	neutral	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
1527	positive	Why is the Israel Police not esteemed by some members of the public, unlike other bodies, and especially by some public servants... who attack the police and its investigators only because they fulfill their duty?
482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov

878	neutral	[Dylan] did one, asked Willie Nelson to do one, asked me to do one, and I think Lucinda Williams and Alan Jackson are on it, too,
855	neutral	A defeat like this does have an effect too. When I was a player, I lost my first two Davis Cup matches in the Czech Republic, before winning the trophy at a later stage.
627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
1564	positive	I heard about a meeting to soon be held between Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah and Development and Liberation bloc MP Ali Hassan Khalil. This is the right track… because Chatah should be informed about projects to be implemented,
1051	negative	The commonplace dodge between PSD and PDL, but especially the reelection of Traian Basescu are two major reasons for PNL to close ranks and to position ourselves as the only alternative to the current (non)governance,

132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
205_ 8	neutral	With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
267_ 7	positive	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
