168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
308_ 5	neutral	...
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .

179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .

282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...

259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .

106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .

108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .

249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .

285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
226_ 15	neutral	con :
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
173_ 0	neutral	summary
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
173_ 13	neutral	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
203_ 2	positive	* slick-looking design and improved interface
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
231_ 15	positive	interface - practically seamless .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .

208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !

271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .

256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .

278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
212_ 3	neutral	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .

207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
254_ 9	neutral	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
230_ 1	neutral	pros :
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
164_ 0	positive	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
244_ 4	neutral	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
209_ 4	positive	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
186_ 27	neutral	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
140_ 22	negative	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
110_ 9	positive	it is a very amazing product .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
215_ 17	positive	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
254_ 11	neutral	go get it .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .

142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .

109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .

280_ 0	neutral	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .

191_ 12	neutral	3 . it 's a hazard in the car .

136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
260_ 7	neutral	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
184_ 5	positive	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .

145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .

300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
183_ 3	negative	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
142_ 1	positive	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
215_ 21	positive	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .

214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
187_ 8	negative	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
215_ 39	neutral	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
204_ 7	neutral	solution ?
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
229_ 2	positive	price !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
173_ 56	neutral	software :
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
222_ 12	negative	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
213_ 19	negative	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
274_ 24	neutral	reason ?
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
162_ 28	neutral	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
247_ 5	positive	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
208_ 15	negative	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :
155_ 0	neutral	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
136_ 3	neutral	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
186_ 30	neutral	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
166_ 0	positive	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
184_ 2	positive	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
140_ 14	neutral	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
274_ 23	negative	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
123_ 36	neutral	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
183_ 4	neutral	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .

222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .

309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
234_ 2	neutral	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
151_ 8	negative	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
115_ 8	neutral	that meant even less light and just as much action .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
215_ 55	neutral	my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music !
298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
120_ 0	neutral	i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
186_ 60	negative	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
123_ 30	neutral	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
274_ 29	neutral	24 hours ?
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
151_ 5	neutral	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
236_ 11	neutral	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
274_ 39	neutral	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
217_ 6	neutral	cons :
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
215_ 25	negative	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
160_ 6	neutral	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
247_ 11	neutral	i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
162_ 3	neutral	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
126_ 0	neutral	i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
153_ 8	neutral	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
154_ 6	neutral	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
166_ 11	neutral	note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
227_ 2	neutral	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
122_ 1	neutral	why ?
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
140_ 4	neutral	there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
209_ 5	positive	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
109_ 8	positive	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
302_ 14	positive	great features .. .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
111_ 3	positive	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
186_ 12	neutral	this almost made it worth the price alone .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
155_ 15	positive	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
162_ 21	positive	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
268_ 0	positive	seriously ! i love it !
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
107_ 7	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
243_ 10	negative	. lens cap is a really annoying
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
222_ 1	positive	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
202_ 1	neutral	cheaper in every way .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .

307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
140_ 18	neutral	negatives ?
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
173_ 45	positive	the price compared to the ipod is great .
287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .
215_ 33	neutral	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
246_ 4	neutral	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
186_ 8	neutral	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
231_ 26	positive	it was no problem for me to use their software .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
120_ 3	negative	got way too many blurry pictures .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
140_ 11	neutral	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
213_ 5	neutral	that 's been my experience .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
208_ 9	neutral	i do n't think so .
229_ 5	positive	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
116_ 32	neutral	instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
154_ 1	neutral	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
265_ 13	neutral	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
270_ 9	positive	8 battery life is excellent .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
210_ 8	negative	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
150_ 2	positive	i had no problems following their installation instructions .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
217_ 8	neutral	i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
262_ 16	positive	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
196_ 0	neutral	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .

279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
270_ 20	neutral	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
232_ 3	neutral	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
208_ 29	negative	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
208_ 50	neutral	if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
220_ 22	negative	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
105_ 5	positive	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
208_ 23	neutral	many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings .
105_ 0	positive	the camera has a wonderful set of features .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
116_ 16	neutral	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
165_ 11	positive	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
300_ 17	neutral	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
118_ 15	positive	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""

286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
223_ 5	neutral	I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
142_ 13	neutral	  !
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
211_ 11	neutral	m.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
45_ 1	neutral	With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
