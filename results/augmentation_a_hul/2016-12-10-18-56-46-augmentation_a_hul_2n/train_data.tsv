1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .

300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :

288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .

294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
231_ 15	positive	interface - practically seamless .
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .

170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .

170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .

245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .

285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .

239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .

200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .

120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .

187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .

170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .

298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .

300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .

305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !

297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .

190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .

110_ 9	positive	it is a very amazing product .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :

225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .

231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .

253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .

212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .

155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .

173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .

200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .

248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
215_ 17	positive	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
254_ 11	neutral	go get it .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
224_ 30	neutral	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
227_ 38	neutral	11 .
159_ 8	neutral	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
234_ 10	neutral	thats it .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
270_ 2	positive	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
310_ 21	neutral	their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
123_ 34	neutral	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
221_ 2	neutral	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
115_ 21	positive	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
115_ 0	negative	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .

203_ 0	neutral	pros :
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .

206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
187_ 8	negative	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
215_ 39	neutral	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
204_ 7	neutral	solution ?
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
229_ 2	positive	price !
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
173_ 56	neutral	software :
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
222_ 12	negative	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
308_ 5	neutral	...
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
217_ 0	neutral	this thing does its job .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
282_ 14	positive	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
213_ 19	negative	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
274_ 24	neutral	reason ?
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
162_ 28	neutral	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
247_ 5	positive	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
208_ 15	negative	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :
155_ 0	neutral	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
136_ 3	neutral	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
186_ 30	neutral	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
166_ 0	positive	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
184_ 2	positive	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
254_ 8	neutral	my pda becames a digital album .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
140_ 14	neutral	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
249_ 9	neutral	i definately recommend a large memory card .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
274_ 23	negative	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
123_ 36	neutral	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
183_ 4	neutral	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
247_ 0	neutral	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
181_ 0	positive	i just bought this player today and i already love it .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
299_ 3	neutral	you do take your chances with this phone .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
234_ 2	neutral	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
151_ 8	negative	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
115_ 8	neutral	that meant even less light and just as much action .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
215_ 55	neutral	my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music !
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
120_ 0	neutral	i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
186_ 60	negative	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
123_ 30	neutral	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
274_ 29	neutral	24 hours ?
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
151_ 5	neutral	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
236_ 11	neutral	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
274_ 39	neutral	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
217_ 6	neutral	cons :
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
215_ 25	negative	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
160_ 6	neutral	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
247_ 11	neutral	i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
162_ 3	neutral	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
126_ 0	neutral	i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
153_ 8	neutral	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
154_ 6	neutral	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
166_ 11	neutral	note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
227_ 2	neutral	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
122_ 1	neutral	why ?
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
140_ 4	neutral	there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
209_ 5	positive	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
109_ 8	positive	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
302_ 14	positive	great features .. .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
111_ 3	positive	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
186_ 12	neutral	this almost made it worth the price alone .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
203_ 2	positive	* slick-looking design and improved interface
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
155_ 15	positive	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
162_ 21	positive	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
268_ 0	positive	seriously ! i love it !
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
107_ 7	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
243_ 10	negative	. lens cap is a really annoying
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .

193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .

246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .

227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .

227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .

226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .

173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .

138_ 4	neutral	one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" .
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .

285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
140_ 18	neutral	negatives ?
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
173_ 45	positive	the price compared to the ipod is great .
287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .
215_ 33	neutral	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
246_ 4	neutral	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
186_ 8	neutral	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
231_ 26	positive	it was no problem for me to use their software .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
120_ 3	negative	got way too many blurry pictures .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
140_ 11	neutral	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
213_ 5	neutral	that 's been my experience .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
208_ 9	neutral	i do n't think so .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
229_ 5	positive	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
116_ 32	neutral	instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
254_ 9	neutral	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .

191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .

287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .

289_ 15	neutral	please !
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
265_ 13	neutral	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
270_ 9	positive	8 battery life is excellent .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
210_ 8	negative	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
150_ 2	positive	i had no problems following their installation instructions .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
217_ 8	neutral	i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
262_ 16	positive	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .

155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
196_ 0	neutral	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .

279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
231_ 22	neutral	software :
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
270_ 20	neutral	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
232_ 3	neutral	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .

173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .

150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
208_ 29	negative	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
208_ 50	neutral	if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
220_ 22	negative	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
244_ 4	neutral	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
154_ 10	neutral	flat out
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
105_ 5	positive	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
208_ 23	neutral	many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings .
105_ 0	positive	the camera has a wonderful set of features .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
116_ 16	neutral	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
165_ 11	positive	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
300_ 17	neutral	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
118_ 15	positive	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.

VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.

DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.

VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.

MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
ELECTRONICS_73_16	negative	I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
VIDEOGAMES_127_30	negative	Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD

107628522297769984	neutral	Comedy central going IN tonight...
256042552246030337	neutral	@gabebachinelo bro you going to that event at Gampel on friday?
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
233_ 18	positive	4. The Build is just right.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
143_ 6	neutral	I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:

73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.

193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
223_ 5	neutral	I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
7_ 0	neutral	I have used many digital cameras.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
