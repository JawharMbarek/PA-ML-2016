247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
20_ 4	neutral	it 's money down the drain .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
96_ 6	positive	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
62_ 4	positive	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
66_ 10	neutral	i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .

148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
191_ 8	neutral	here 's why :
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
97_ 3	neutral	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
9_ 0	positive	it looks great - and is loaded with features .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
39_ 0	negative	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
54_ 2	positive	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
69_ 1	negative	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
4_ 7	neutral	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
100_ 8	neutral	a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
96_ 5	positive	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .

231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
72_ 0	positive	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
0_ 25	neutral	i would recommend buying one .
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
41_ 3	neutral	i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
53_ 4	neutral	back to the 2600 :
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
98_ 3	positive	no matter the format .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
49_ 6	negative	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
39_ 7	neutral	obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
77_ 5	neutral	because , you will be dissapointed .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
136_ 3	neutral	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
46_ 0	neutral	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
43_ 11	negative	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ).
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
10_ 0	positive	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
88_ 4	neutral	2 .
183_ 3	negative	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
61_ 3	neutral	i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
0_ 0	neutral	repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
309_ 20	negative	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
63_ 4	neutral	great feature list , poor reliability .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
72_ 3	positive	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
36_ 9	positive	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
68_ 4	neutral	i am returning the broken one today .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
56_ 1	positive	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
32_ 0	neutral	wow !
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
9_ 1	negative	unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
37_ 4	neutral	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
63_ 0	neutral	i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
173_ 60	neutral	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
43_ 6	negative	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
59_ 7	neutral	it 's not a big deal for me .
288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .
31_ 0	neutral	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
33_ 0	negative	this dvd play is basicly junk .
83_ 2	neutral	when i hit "" menu "" it told me , "" playback only . ""
74_ 5	neutral	i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
46_ 3	neutral	very happy !
155_ 20	positive	 ^
16_ 3	neutral	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
26_ 2	positive	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
91_ 7	neutral	after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
70_ 5	negative	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
6_ 4	neutral	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
88_ 1	neutral	the plus points are -
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :

23_ 1	neutral	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .

134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
86_ 6	neutral	ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
90_ 3	neutral	so far not going to get a good review .
1_ 9	positive	it sure does !
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
1_ 8	positive	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
265_ 12	neutral	read the directions !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
59_ 15	neutral	be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
91_ 5	negative	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
71_ 1	neutral	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
66_ 2	neutral	this is the third apex dvd i bought .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
54_ 4	negative	for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the carribean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
141_ 0	positive	i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
1_ 2	positive	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
102_ 1	positive	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
75_ 11	neutral	if only it played stand alone avi files .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
173_ 0	neutral	summary
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
17_ 1	positive	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
33_ 9	neutral	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
11_ 4	neutral	i think you get what you pay for stands true .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
2_ 1	neutral	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
71_ 8	neutral	they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
9_ 3	negative	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
115_ 0	negative	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
48_ 1	negative	it has never worked .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
74_ 7	negative	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
86_ 8	negative	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
55_ 11	neutral	take my words and give it a try .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
16_ 2	negative	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
56_ 3	positive	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
57_ 0	neutral	worked for two weeks .
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
73_ 2	positive	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
56_ 0	neutral	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
75_ 9	positive	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
99_ 5	positive	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
16_ 0	neutral	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
32_ 9	neutral	consider it for a future gift too !
76_ 1	positive	but for what i do use it is perfect .
95_ 1	neutral	it goes nicely with my apex 27 "" in my bedroom .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
60_ 1	negative	the remote is a little hard to understand .
309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
58_ 0	negative	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
87_ 0	neutral	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
120_ 3	negative	got way too many blurry pictures .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
92_ 4	neutral	what is up .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
39_ 3	neutral	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
97_ 4	positive	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
44_ 2	positive	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
54_ 3	negative	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
77_ 3	neutral	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
55_ 3	neutral	so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
77_ 0	neutral	hi , many people are saying , "" you get what you pay for , i guess . ""
81_ 4	neutral	had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
33_ 2	neutral	keeps coming up with no disk errors .
0_ 21	positive	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
93_ 3	negative	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
26_ 4	positive	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
101_ 7	positive	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .

226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .

73_ 3	positive	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .

117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .

231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
17_ 4	negative	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
13_ 7	neutral	amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .

162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
32_ 5	neutral	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
0_ 7	neutral	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
4_ 8	negative	apex does n't answer the phone .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..

200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
87_ 3	negative	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
21_ 2	negative	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
59_ 12	neutral	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .

249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
94_ 1	negative	can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
92_ 6	neutral	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
1_ 10	positive	that 's a rare and valuable feature .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
49_ 2	neutral	the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
102_ 2	positive	the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
93_ 5	positive	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
93_ 0	neutral	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
47_ 2	neutral	i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
0_ 23	neutral	i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
100_ 4	positive	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
55_ 2	neutral	now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
6_ 0	positive	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
227_ 46	neutral	2 .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
39_ 1	neutral	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
51_ 4	neutral	no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
5_ 0	negative	no way to contact their customer service .
33_ 10	neutral	spend the money its well worth it .
32_ 8	neutral	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
86_ 10	neutral	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
4_ 3	negative	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
43_ 4	positive	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
96_ 8	neutral	only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
155_ 8	positive	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
76_ 2	neutral	i was , however .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
18_ 0	negative	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work "" apex "" dvd players and none worked .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
47_ 8	neutral	i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
43_ 2	positive	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
87_ 4	neutral	i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
31_ 10	neutral	bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
31_ 7	neutral	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
84_ 5	neutral	these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
76_ 0	positive	i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
69_ 4	negative	only one disk played through to completion successfully .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
57_ 3	negative	apex sucks !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
43_ 9	neutral	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
10_ 4	negative	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . ""
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
1_ 3	positive	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
81_ 0	neutral	i bought this for my dad for christmas .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
22_ 2	negative	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
13_ 4	negative	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
92_ 1	neutral	the case had ad2600 .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
100_ 0	neutral	yep .
11_ 0	neutral	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
49_ 10	neutral	i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
35_ 0	negative	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !

142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .

200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .

157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
26_ 11	positive	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .

39_ 5	neutral	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
186_ 30	neutral	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .

49_ 1	negative	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
43_ 5	neutral	bad :
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .

28_ 2	positive	loved the slim design .
65_ 4	negative	p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
99_ 2	neutral	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .

282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
97_ 7	neutral	if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .

249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
53_ 12	positive	remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
72_ 4	neutral	recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
41_ 7	neutral	"" you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
31_ 4	neutral	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
32_ 4	neutral	i also own an "" apex ad 1201 "" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
19_ 2	negative	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
55_ 0	neutral	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
42_ 1	neutral	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
93_ 2	positive	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
66_ 11	neutral	you should too .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
10_ 5	neutral	this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
88_ 6	neutral	3 .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
127_ 6	positive	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
13_ 2	negative	wo n't play a lot of discs .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
98_ 4	neutral	awesome !
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
12_ 1	negative	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
0_ 16	neutral	for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
52_ 6	neutral	i will say this .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
80_ 5	positive	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
60_ 5	neutral	i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
32_ 2	neutral	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
71_ 0	neutral	what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
300_ 2	neutral	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
13_ 10	neutral	i repeat - do n't wast your money .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
77_ 12	neutral	4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
87_ 2	negative	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
17_ 2	positive	even viewed cds full of jpgs .
173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
103_ 4	negative	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
3_ 1	neutral	for the money , get a better quality player .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
50_ 6	neutral	i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
68_ 5	neutral	i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
88_ 7	positive	good looks
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
65_ 1	neutral	so far we have only hooked up one of them .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
12_ 3	neutral	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
92_ 3	neutral	picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
75_ 2	negative	the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
23_ 7	negative	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
28_ 0	positive	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
14_ 3	neutral	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
104_ 0	neutral	positives
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
84_ 1	negative	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .

194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
88_ 0	positive	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
10_ 13	negative	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .

285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .

204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .

3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .

275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
1_ 15	neutral	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .

142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
55_ 7	positive	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
55_ 5	neutral	i have a dvd burner .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
75_ 0	neutral	i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
32_ 6	neutral	and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
22_ 1	neutral	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
0_ 15	neutral	by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
47_ 1	neutral	i bought this dvd player in november .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .

285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .

62_ 1	neutral	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
16_ 6	negative	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
41_ 5	neutral	i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
66_ 9	neutral	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .

MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
MUSIC_86_12	negative	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.
ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
DVDS_39_7	positive	Of the eight actresses who portray the clueless Aviva, Wilkins stands out as the most memorable if not largely for her zaftig woman-child interpretation with her borderline gargantuan stature (the impression is of a giantess growing in mid-transformation with the sundresses nearly bursting from her ample body) but displays some real emotion in her confusion and dismay at just wanting to be loved and to love someone that makes her few moments on screen so memorable.
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
ELECTRONICS_227_6	positive	Truly fantastic pictures.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
ELECTRONICS_58_7	negative	I only had a short time to use the unit.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
BOOKS_5_5	negative	This is not the book for your goal.
BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
VIDEOGAMES_271_13	negative	Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
DVDS_37_4	negative	It never came.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
DVDS_32_1	negative	The latest pretender to the throne is a horse of another color (and yes the pun is meant to be offensive).
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
ELECTRONICS_71_6	negative	-The camera shutter sound does not turn off, so even if your phone is on silent, if the camera button gets pressed, your phone makes an annoying noise.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
ELECTRONICS_72_10	negative	First I went to Radio Shack, they didn't have the kit, and had no adapter that would fit the camera.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
DVDS_33_3	negative	The gore effects are a mixed lot with buckets of viscera for the masses and a hammy â€“ cry for help from Englund as the germ-phobic flamboyant joint owner (!) and porn- star supreme Jameson as the first of the afflicted strippers (!!) You've been warned â€“ although I did like Bach's 'assets' as the busty gung-ho jarhead (and sadly the only one who isn't nude!
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
BOOKS_7_17	negative	Oh but this hurt Luke too bad for Jedi techniques to work.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
MUSIC_94_10	positive	has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered...
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
DVDS_32_3	negative	Adding fuel to the fire is many turns in this serpentine crime drama that offers about as much suspense as a re-run of any form of ""Law & Order"": Timmer may or may not have been having an affair with the deceased assailant, may or may not know the true identity of the mysterious local kingpin and may or may not be involved in a convoluted scheme involving high-level real estate conspiracies with the aforementioned gangsta.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
DVDS_52_17	positive	There are also equal amounts of chemistry between the trio of male friends who are all looking out for the best interests of Garner's character (as well as their own well-meaning agendas overall without being creepy or downright chauvinistic).
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
ELECTRONICS_65_3	neutral	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
DVDS_194_7	neutral	Let's! Acting from Michael Chiklis (not anymore) was OK. I just didn't get into his character the thing.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
BOOKS_11_5	positive	I was really enjoying that style of writing.
BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
VIDEOGAMES_143_11	positive	Bottom line love Star wars get it.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.

VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8

DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,

132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.

205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.

107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.

203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.

174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.

195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.

308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
188_ 9	positive	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
132_ 479	neutral	 Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
205_ 8	neutral	With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
179_ 11	neutral	) as opposed to "gateway", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.

91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
119_ 7	positive	You just can't go wrong with this one!
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
132_ 79	negative	 The interface took a little getting used to.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
183_ 17	neutral	2.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.

213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
83_ 6	positive	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!

263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
190_ 16	negative	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.

209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.

100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
244_ 0	neutral	The title pretty much says it all.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
132_ 523	neutral	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
