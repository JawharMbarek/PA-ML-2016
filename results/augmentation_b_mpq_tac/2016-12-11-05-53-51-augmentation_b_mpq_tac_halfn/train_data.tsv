DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!

MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
