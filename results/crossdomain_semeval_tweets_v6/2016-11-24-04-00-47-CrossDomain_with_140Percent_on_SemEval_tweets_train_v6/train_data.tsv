1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

490	negative	Talk of a Grand Strategy betrays the real intentions of the European Commission. 'The idea that we might turn our military bases over to the EU, for projects the British people have never given their assent to, is a twisted fantasy.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
42	negative	Gordon Brown's conference speech should be the shortest in political history. Just one word - sorry.

426	negative	Once the PKK is eliminated there are no bounds to what is possible: you are our neighbours and kinsmen.
1099	neutral	I am certain that we should neither be seen to second-guess the contents of the final Competition Commission report, nor the response of the airport operator until after it has had time to consider its findings and implications.

822	neutral	Simulation is not new but I think we did really bring it to Formula One more aggressively than anyone has in the past and hopefully that will give us an advantage this season,
1174	negative	The police do nothing. When we first went to them and told them that spurious liquor was killing people here, they just laughed t us. They said they had all died their natural deaths. Now, we will make sure that this mafia is completely rooted out of this area,

1133	negative	It worries me and it should also worry Hamas. That is why I would recommend to Hamas to quickly make a deal. They will not get better terms than these,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.

220	neutral	We have Prime Minister Tsvangirai and his deputies here with us - that is what it should be.
1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1194	negative	Tory plans to raise revenue looked flaky six months ago, but now we are in a recession they look even more like fantasy figures. 'With the Shadow Cabinet clearly confused, it is time that David Cameron came clean on what tax rises or spending cuts he will make to plug the holes in his tax plans.
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission. It is a test of Barroso's courage and conviction. Today should be an important day in the history of international financial markets - but we shall see if the current conservative European Commission is capable of taking the recommended steps.
1572	negative	We live in a democracy but I note from the Standards in Public Office Commission today that it expects everyone to live by the same rules as everyone else and I hope that whatever incomplete information he [Ganley] was able to give so far will be given.

Over the past week, Obama's administration has launched detailed plans to stabilize financial markets, including a huge programme to mop up toxic assets that are at the root of the worsening recession.
