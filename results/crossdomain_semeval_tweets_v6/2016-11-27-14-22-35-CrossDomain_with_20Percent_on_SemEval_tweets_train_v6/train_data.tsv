39	negative	Gordon Brown is deeply implicated in the mistakes of the past. Even if he won't apologise, he can't escape them.
228	neutral	No one is above the law. If you are charged with a crime, you must stand up and face those charges in a court of law. President Al-Bashir will have the opportunity to do this before the International Criminal Court,

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy.

44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility.

MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
BOOKS_18_15	negative	Some explanations seem to be too simplistic.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
DVDS_38_6	negative	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
BOOKS_22_4	positive	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
DVDS_48_3	negative	Second, he goes from a bundled up neurotic basket-case white collar worker and then becomes ""Jason Bourne."" Third, if that isn't enough, the bad guy thugs shoot him and obviously everyone in the theater can see he's only winged and ""they"" leave him while exiting the house with nary a cop in sight while a patrol car sits out front with two murdered officers leaning on a horn blaring away.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_134_35	negative	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.
DVDS_35_4	negative	Running and skipping and jumping and playing with dolls, by age 12 most girls are throwing out their dolls because they want to be more mature and are becoming interested in sex, which is exactly what Lolita was doing in the novel, she was smack-dab in-between the child world and adult world.
BOOKS_24_4	positive	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
BOOKS_13_3	negative	Brain matter on spears?
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
BOOKS_9_10	negative	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
DVDS_38_19	negative	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
ELECTRONICS_63_2	negative	But the headset is huge - it doesnt fit into my ears - none of them, and believe me - both of my ears are of generous size!
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
BOOKS_19_1	negative	I feel like a different voice should have been used though.
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
BOOKS_14_6	positive	But in the end it all came together.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
ELECTRONICS_71_10	negative	-The main reason I am getting rid of this phone is because of the charging/charger/battery.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
DVDS_48_2	negative	First, Bacon decides to get revenge with little preparation.
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
DVDS_45_4	negative	I believe that it would have been a lot better in black and white like the original.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
MUSIC_264_5	positive	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
ELECTRONICS_71_12	negative	When I went to charge it, it would charge for a few minutes, and then stop.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
BOOKS_5_15	positive	CONCLUSION: This book may be a good gift for your child (10 to 13 years old) if she has any interest in reading.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
BOOKS_6_1	negative	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_271_10	negative	Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
