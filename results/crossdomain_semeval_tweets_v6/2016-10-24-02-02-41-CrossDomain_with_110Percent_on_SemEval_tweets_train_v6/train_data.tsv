772	neutral	Last year, we lent Poland 2.8 billion euro, which means that by far Poland is the main beneficiary of EIB lending among the new member states and we intend to increase these figures this year.

44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
313	neutral	Is patriotism something you like only when it is brandished by Barack Obama?

1178	neutral	Murr opposed the obstruction of the presidential elections. He supported Bkirki and its principles, which were violated. The development of his position led to rapprochement. However, this possibility does not mean that we authorized MP Murr to form alliances in the Metn. His vision of the [electoral] battle in the Metn is different from ours,

663	neutral	We will accept the Supreme Court's decision whatever it may be
307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.
340	positive	They are bailing out just about anybody that shows up and says they need cash. The public has grown weary of it and instead of throwing a banker to the wolves they have decided to throw Wagoner to the wolves,

757	negative	I think Scudamore is an absolute disgrace,
1063	negative	the media reports today that a large bomb has been prepared by the Real IRA for an attack in Britain underline the need for a strong security response. The murders are appalling but this business of preparing bombs for use in Britain just cannot be contemplated

213	positive	We are commending Sen. Specter for putting American jobs first and opposing card check legislation,
988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,

353	neutral	I wish to express my sincere condolences to the families, friends and comrades of the two soldiers who were tragically murdered last night (Saturday) and those who were injured. My thoughts are with them all at this extremely difficult time. Northern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said there must not be any retaliation for the attack. He said:

1075	neutral	We have spent a long time with Pakistan Muslim League-N and we want to resolve all the issues with the PML-N in an amicable manner.
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February. On the one hand, the ministry needed to pay out its outstanding debt to business operators, the now famous 2 billion euros, and then it needed to offset the almost 7?percent deficit in the revenue projected and revenue collected,
344	neutral	The decision on captaincy was taken by keeping into account three considerations. One, player's availability during each phase of the tournament; two, flexibility in selection of playing squad during the phases; and three, the fact that Dravid will not be available due to personal reasons for the entire tournament,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
1510	neutral	If we see the Varun Gandhi issue, his (Kumar's) secular conduct is in the clear,

247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.
301	neutral	It's almost like Barack Obama is using late night to give us all a little hug before we go to sleep at night,
1205	negative	These recruitment figures show the real priority of the people running the NHS. 'It is shocking that a service which is meant to be about frontline medical care is taking on far more managers and bureaucrats than it is medical staff.
354	neutral	We know about Deputy Dempsey now.
328	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.

191	neutral	The ambassador was trying to get things resolved between Mr Sharif and the government,

760	negative	I don't think it's appropriate that the taxpayer should be providing any more benefits to Fred Goodwin.
781	neutral	If that is the worldwide standard and if all the countries agree to that, then I think it would be strange if the EU member states that are part of the G20 say something different,

567	neutral	I am happy to announce the alliance. We would campaign together for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections,
997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders. NABIS's specialist CSI-style analysis of ballistics - effectively giving guns and bullets a fingerprint which can be tracked - will help police to match guns to offenders in double quick time.
618	negative	The Conservatives have tried to brush this under the carpet but the official report finds Caroline Spelman was using taxpayers' money to pay for her nanny.
1452	positive	Only 37 of the total members of Parliament are females. But I am glad to see that things are much different at Delhi University where the female achievers outnumber the men,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,
1117	negative	We definitely don't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by Hamas and serve Hamas's extremist purposes,
1364	positive	There was no bust-up with Ronaldo % he was nowhere near me. I have no problem with Cristiano and I shook hands with him at the end.
393	negative	The plans submitted by General Motors and Chrysler to the government of Canada do not go far enough to ensure the long-term viability of these companies,

1404	neutral	strengthen NATO in that France of course would take a significant number of important positions within the integrated military structure. It would also give a wind in the sails of European defence,
1541	neutral	But I was asleep! So he recorded a little answerphone message and Jack (husband Jack Tweed) played it to me,
1222	neutral	said Eugenio Diaz-Bonilla, the bank's executive director for Argentina and Haiti. Last year's losses were offset partially by $600 million in interest income, giving the bank $19.4 billion in equity at the end of 2008, Moreno told Lugar in a Feb. 11 letter. The two men have exchanged a series of letters since Lugar first inquired on Feb. 5 about the losses. In them, Moreno sought to assure the senator that risk management procedures deemed deficient in an independent December audit are in fact in place and

768	neutral	How can there be any specific legal case against Fred Goodwin, who has been given a package and has signed off that package?
391	neutral	When General Motors got its bailout, it required General Motors to renegotiate its labor contracts with the unions. Likewise, the federal government could have required AIG to renegotiate its contracts,

1461	neutral	Crude prices are up, I think, in a knee-jerk reaction to the news of Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy ship in the South China Sea,
1200	neutral	Oh no, come on - this is small beer in the NHS budget.
1313	positive	Bratislava is home to one of Volkswagen's factories, which stands out for its high quality. For this reason as well as on the grounds of good conditions for futher investments, Slovakia is considering pushing for the manufacture of a new Volkswagen in Bratislava,

15	positive	This was a great meeting where we discussed the key issues surrounding climate change policy with international leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who have already gained valuable insight on how such policies may affect manufacturing and economic opportunities,
206	negative	We take note, with concern, of the views and comments of Finance Minister Trevor Manuel.
655	neutral	If we had taken the decision to allow LIAT to simply fold, the fact is that Caribbean Star... would have been subject to the decision of the US Supreme Court, there would have been a receiver, the assets would have been frozen... we would have had a real problem, a crisis, genuine crisis,

1261	neutral	Oil Movements shows OPEC output down another 350,000 bpd in latest week and that didn't hurt the bulls,
1441	positive	the problem of Afghanistan cannot be resolved in one day. That's why we need a permanent table for consultations between NATO, Russia and those nations contributing to stabilization in the medium-term.
1272	neutral	With world oil stocks at 61 days - including floating storage - OPEC will have to move to full compliance to make a significant dent in these inventories during the weak spring demand period,
1114	negative	I cannot accept the approach of some of Europe's leaders, who view Hamas as the symbol of responsibility and peace, failing to understand that it is a murderous terror organization preventing peace,
1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
996	neutral	If we really want consumers to buy green, the sustainable choice must be an easy choice. Product information must be clear, and sustainable products must not be a luxury option. European retailers are in a unique position to help us get there. They are a part of consumers' everyday life and can have an immediate impact on the choices they make. That is why I am truly happy to launch the Forum today, alongside Commissioner Dimas. And I believe this is a good starting point for a concerted approach among reta

1134	positive	Hamas exerts its utmost effort to end the peevish rift which has divided the Palestinian family and destroyed the Palestinian society,

587	neutral	We are aware that some people resident in other countries within the European Union needing transplants are being referred to the UK.

1238	neutral	We have been quite comfortable with 3-1 combination. When it comes to three seamers and one spinner, we have part timers who have proved that they can get wickets in Test cricket also. You have Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and Sachin Tendulkar who can bowl if it is turning,
543	negative	Regarding the Dalai Lama's overseas activities, we resolutely oppose any country's government having official contact with the Dalai Lama or enabling or offering a platform for his splittist activities,
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.

607	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,

765	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
572	neutral	The UPA is no longer united ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. It has proved to be an opportunistic alliance, unlike the NDA (National democratic Alliance) which is united and strong,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.

While the SP won't field candidates in Rae Bareli and Amethi, the Congress will not contest in Mainpuri and Kannauj, the strongholds of Mulayam and son Akhilesh Yadav.

253	neutral	The Security Council should condemn the fact that an indicted war criminal has deliberately put yet more lives at risk by expelling aid workers,

1068	neutral	The Commission starts from the position that a Parliament which reflects the make-up of the nation it represents will result in better legislation and a higher degree of public confidence in the democratic process.
67	negative	The message this sends out is that President Mugabe is still supportive of the criminal and lawless behaviour of his officials who want to loot and grab,
1429	positive	We are confident that we can create a process whereby NATO, which is already strong, becomes stronger, where we become more effective in coordinating our efforts in Afghanistan,
1085	neutral	LeBron defended the last few minutes on Kevin Martin,

722	neutral	The agreement with the IMF will play a major part in reviving lending. Of the amount we will borrow from the IMF, about two thirds will go to the central bank and less than one third to the Finance Ministry, and, from there, a sum will be distributed to banks, to be used for granting loans,
1074	positive	The Treasury Department plan is based on the sound principle that if we are to revive our economy , we must unfreeze the credit markets so people can get the loans they need,

469	neutral	If the process of integrating . . . members into the state security services and other institutions is frustrated, as it looks very much it will be, then this will leave a huge opportunity for Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has been down but never out, to get back into the game,
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
13	negative	Some of the policies followed by President Bush have given rise to a lot of anti-American feeling in Pakistan,

775	neutral	We must do our utmost to bringing internet technologies to all citizens of Europe.

1131	positive	Any upcoming government must be based to the results of the elections that authorizes Hamas to select the prime minister,
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,

784	neutral	Without enough good quality water our economies and societies can neither thrive nor survive. Europeans realise the seriousness of the issue and they understand that action is needed to maintain clean and sufficient water resources for the survival of our society. Member States must swiftly take steps to fully implement all EU legislation on water.
122	negative	This hit on tax receipts is a real blow to Alastair Darling's budget hopes,
409	neutral	Low carbon growth is the only growth story, because high carbon growth would eventually choke itself off. The world would react strongly to an America lead as we go forward to build an international deal at the United Nations climate change conference in Copenhagen at the end of this year.
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,

Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi
984	neutral	The transfer of authority from elected local councils to a new quango, which will make more planning decisions than in any other National Park, is a step in precisely the wrong direction at a time when local communities should be given more of a say over their own affairs, not less.

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable.
