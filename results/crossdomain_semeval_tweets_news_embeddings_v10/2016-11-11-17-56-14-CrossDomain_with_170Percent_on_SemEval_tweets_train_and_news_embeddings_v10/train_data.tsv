230	neutral	We are closely watching the regional moves, but holding Al-Bashir accountable in The Hague is not negotiable.
784	neutral	Without enough good quality water our economies and societies can neither thrive nor survive.

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our

1519	neutral	I think that the case of our councilors is ripe to go even before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

1123	negative	If it turns out that Hamas has not got the message, it will be hit again,

942	neutral	There is no quick or easy solution to protect clubs from the global crisis ... but one proposal which seems to be gaining a consensus is limiting professional contracts like we have already in the Champions League,
1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists
1251	neutral	Oil is rallying primarily due to the speculation that OPEC will cut production,
627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,

773	neutral	We intend to do whatever we can to encourage maximum take up of this exemption by our member states. Micro entities could save as much as €1,200 each year, if member states follow our lead on this one. In the current climate, that is no mean saving,

1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

971	neutral	During the visit that I'll pay to Brussels on the occasion of the meeting of the Socialist leaders, which precedes the European Council, we intend to propose a few names for the European commissioner that Romania will have to send after the elections for the European Parliament.

1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more.

699	neutral	This is the price of New Labour's

49	negative	Central to Gordon Brown's attempt to draw a political dividing line with the Conservatives in the run up to the Budget, has been his claim that the whole world is signed up to yet more debt-funded fiscal stimulus.
985	neutral	The Guardian Council is the sole authority allowed to interpret the Constitution, therefore the president's involvement in such issues is against the law,

1189	neutral	Orszag told reporters. Deficits so big put upward pressure on interest rates as the government offers more attractive interest rates to attract borrowers. I think deficits of 5 percent (of GDP) are unsupportable,
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,
309	positive	The challenge for everyone is that (Obama's new language) is a prelude to a sincere change (of direction) in US and European foreign policy,
371	neutral	This bill is nothing more than an attempt for everybody to cover their butt up here on Capitol Hill,

408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations. The Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deserve praise for sending a strong warning signal to the UN. Unfortunately, the efforts by the U.S. administration to ameliorate this process have not succeeded,
880	neutral	It's worrisome that two public corporations have received a credit downgrading in less than a week: the Ports Authority and Highways and Transportation. Standard and Poor's actions is a forceful sign that the credit rating agencies will continue watching with a stern eye the steps that this government takes in relation to its fiscal matters.

697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
390	neutral	Last week, I signed an accord concerning Jersey and [budget minister] Eric Woerth will soon sign an accord concerning the Isle of Man,

758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule.

I have been following this programme closel

'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time.
