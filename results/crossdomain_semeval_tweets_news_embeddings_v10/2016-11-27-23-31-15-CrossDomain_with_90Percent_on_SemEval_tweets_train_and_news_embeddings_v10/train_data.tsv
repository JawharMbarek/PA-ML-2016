721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February. On the one hand, the ministry needed to pay out its outstanding debt to business operators, the now famous 2 billion euros, and then it needed to offset the almost 7?percent deficit in the revenue projected and revenue collected,

197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension.

1073	positive	It seems the IRS and Treasury Department went out of their way to knock out an emerging, effective and evenhanded way to collect tax debt that the IRS will otherwise never collect,
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.

179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.

10	neutral	This is the PM who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto,

390	neutral	Last week, I signed an accord concerning Jersey and [budget minister] Eric Woerth will soon sign an accord concerning the Isle of Man,
229	neutral	I don't want to condemn Gen. Bashir nor condone impunity. It will be constructive to defer or suspend the ICC indictments on Gen Bashir,

6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
1064	negative	I supported the IRA during the conflict, I myself was a member of the IRA but that war is over,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
440	neutral	I want to make sure that our family, as well as the staff and all the people who come to the White House and eat our food, get access to really fresh vegetables and fruits,

1210	neutral	There can be no greater injury than the killing of one's spouse. The attempts to make the position of Mrs Hani irrelevant is completely out of context with our common law,

227	neutral	When the issue came up, we said we cannot condemn Gen. Bashir out of hand and we cannot condone what he is alleged to have done. We decided the best thing was to send our own high level team to do the investigations. That is what we are doing,

1128	neutral	No one has asked Hamas or any other faction to recognize Israel or the deals with Washington,
1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

477	neutral	Slovenia wants the circumstances that led to the holdup to change, and we welcome the initiative by the European Commission on mediation. I said this to my Swedish colleague and understood that the Swedes, who are inclined to further EU expansion, firstly Croatia, expect that the mediation will be successful, and that Croatia will be able to continue the negotiations

297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
591	neutral	Since June 2003, the European Union only allows imports of chilli products which have been tested and are certified to be free from contamination by the Sudan 1 dye. In addition, Member States are obliged to carry out surveillance of the products on the market.

Mars Group also called on Wako to cooperate with the US authorities to save the country from any further losses.

1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more. Isn't this a direct admission that people who vote for BSP and DPS cannot ever read the ballots?

456	neutral	I think it's the safe haven on the Pakistani side of the border, not just for Al-Qaeda but for the Taliban for the Hakani network, for Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and other affiliated groups that are all working together — they're separate groups, but they're all working together, and I think as long as they have a safe haven to operate there, it's going to be a problem for us,

492	neutral	It is for the US to decide how best to regulate Internet gambling in its market, but this must be done in a way that fully respects WTO obligations. I am hopeful that we can find a swift, negotiated solution to this issue.

The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

326	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.
73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.

1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

619	negative	I am not given the floor in Moscow so why not use some of my resources and knowledge to challenge in another city where they still have the chance of a fair election? People are not happy with the way they are being treated as far as the Olympics are concerned so it won't be easy to put a United Russia stamp on this election.
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.

He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed
