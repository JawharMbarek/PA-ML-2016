611	neutral	If you're any of those six at this point, you don't want to go to the twenty-five countries that make up the European Union, because you may be subject to immediate arrest. What will happen next is this investigation will most likely continue in a very vigorous form,

1494	positive	A rights body is not only a campaign on behalf of ASEAN. We are very serious about its establishment, and Indonesia will make sure it sets an example for it. ASEAN is not only about pursuing prosperity, but also democracy, and that includes the rule of law, protection of human rights, and freedom of press. Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,
827	neutral	The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities,

1161	neutral	There is a drop in rocket attacks and only one rocket from a small organization was fired in recent days. There are two reasons for this: Hamas is not interested in an escalation that will result in another confrontation with Israel, Hamas is making arrests before attacks are carried out. Also, Hamas signed an agreement with the Islamic Jihad saying it would avoid such attacks in the near future,
247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.

637	neutral	The MPC of the South African Reserve Bank will from now onwards meet according to the schedule below.
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
54	negative	Gordon Brown is spending taxpayers' money on the latest digital gimmicks... but can't be bothered to give out a simple email address.
346	neutral	We are the only city where Wall Street is just a subway stop away from Main Street. White-collar crime, as we have seen, affects our pensions, affects our not-for-profit institutions and it affects our businesses,
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
430	negative	I calmed him down and told him not to worry, Begin would get it in the end, because even his opposition wants peace more than him. He was in tears,
59	negative	This is a direct result of Gordon Brown's reckless failure to provide enough prison places. Releasing criminals early has already resulted in three murders and over a thousand other crimes. It is unacceptable and Ministers must scrap this policy now.

102	negative	Whilst in negotiations, Olmert and his government were busy drawing up plans for the devastating assault on Gaza, and approving the rapid expansion of Israeli settlements,
933	neutral	But look at the recent political dynamics. Golkar wants to support its own presidential candidate, and Kalla has declared himself as that candidate. I would have been very embarrassed had I said I would surely pair up with him again,
1111	neutral	The players want to finish on Sunday because they have to leave for Indian Wells (the venue for next week's ATP event), but we?ll see.
82	positive	I have the utmost respect for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. I have faith in Manmohan Singh and I have no problem in the alliance.
72	neutral	You know the secretary-general (Jaap de Hoop Scheffer) has said recently that Iran should be involved in a regional approach in regard of Afghanistan.
605	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,
1281	negative	such a conspiracy will become counterproductive and boomerang on the Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati.
331	neutral	I believe the issue of the deployment of a missile defense facility on Czech soil was among the main and fundamental reasons for Czech society and the Czech opposition to criticize the government led by Topolanek,
240	negative	We have a video footage showing how GERB activists are giving out food products to voters, and a mass fight which breaks out after there are not enough products for everyone. I am going to send this footage together with a martenitsa to Wilfried Martens (the President of the European People's Party of which GERB is a member), who recently declared his support for GERB, in order to show him how they do elections in Bulgaria
253	neutral	The Security Council should condemn the fact that an indicted war criminal has deliberately put yet more lives at risk by expelling aid workers,

1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,
7	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
437	neutral	The White House believes those that have committed atrocities should be held accountable,
448	negative	Now there will be efforts to come up with an excuse not to register the dangerous candidates -- primarily Nemtsov and Lebedev. They might let Lugovoi in, although that, of course, would be a bit of a scandal for the election,
940	neutral	If you want to win the Champions League you have to play with the best in Europe. So we'll take the challenge,
1227	neutral	Christian Chivu, Walter Samuel, Materazzi and Burdisso are out.
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
366	negative	If Alex Salmond is defending the Dunfermline building society and the directors, he is really defending the indefensible.
1507	neutral	If Varun Gandhi's comments are correct, then it is very unfortunate,
1133	negative	It worries me and it should also worry Hamas. That is why I would recommend to Hamas to quickly make a deal. They will not get better terms than these,
1189	neutral	Orszag told reporters. Deficits so big put upward pressure on interest rates as the government offers more attractive interest rates to attract borrowers. I think deficits of 5 percent (of GDP) are unsupportable,
1536	neutral	To date, the SBU has moved forward with a proposal to the FSB of Russia, and we have handed a draft cooperation agreement on declassification of all archives of the punitive agencies of the Soviet Union,
113	negative	The only difference between [Khodorkovsky] and any other large-scale business at the time was his anti-Kremlin stance,
1128	neutral	No one has asked Hamas or any other faction to recognize Israel or the deals with Washington,
1245	neutral	We will continue to be surprised on the bearish side by the data that's coming out - this keeps the demand deterioration argument very much alive, and pushes the OPEC production cuts to the backburner, precluding OPEC from becoming a significant force in this market,
1483	positive	In the context of what we're doing, Secretary Geithner was notified, he has said, last week. As he reported to the rest of us, he moved aggressively and immediately, aggressively and immediately, to recoup whatever could be legally recouped. He recognized that you can't just abrogate contracts willy-nilly, but he moved to do what could be done.
735	negative	The appointment of Dennis Ross, whose track record shows his unacceptable radical viewpoints about Iran, is inconsistent with Mr. Obama's claims about his willingness to create change in Iran-US relations and contains no positive messages for Iran,
377	neutral	Regional parties want to throw out the national parties. And, the national parties do not want regional parties to occupy national space. This will be there and this will happen in every election. That is why (RJD Chief) Lalu Prasad is saying what he is saying,
194	neutral	I came to meet Mr Nawaz Sharif with an olive branch from the government, with a message from President Asif Ali Zardari that the situation demands greater reconciliation because Pakistan faces great challenges,
5	positive	We're invited to comment on the events of the day and along the way, we remind people that there was, indeed, good news under President Bush,
1410	neutral	nothing today justifies re-entering the Nato military command
1425	neutral	The secretary is not backing off his fundamental criticism that NATO needs to do a better job in training for counterinsurgency. But he is not -- nor has he ever -- criticized any particular nation for their service in Afghanistan.
67	negative	The message this sends out is that President Mugabe is still supportive of the criminal and lawless behaviour of his officials who want to loot and grab,
511	neutral	When we gave the 2002 World Cup to South Korea and Japan there were sporting and political reasons to share it,
1236	neutral	There was a slight improvement to the batsmen other than Sehwag,
1460	neutral	My forecasting record on this recession is about the same as the win-loss record of the Washington Nationals.
183	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,

497	neutral	Bob Hawke is nowhere near as Irish as I am,
150	neutral	I am ready for the talks (on seat-sharing) if Congress wants. Sonia Gandhi should take a decision in the interest of her party,

520	neutral	We do not have doubts on playing at the World Cup in South Africa 2010,
1209	neutral	Mrs Hani is a victim. The loss of her husband [due to Derby-Lewis' actions] has made her a victim. By participating, there is some comfort to the victim.
680	neutral	It's hugely dangerous to the Labour Party,
1230	neutral	Australia will only support changes within the International Whaling Commission that bring us closer to our goals to eliminate whaling for good,
626	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
1256	neutral	I thought the OPEC cuts would have had more of an effect by now,
1458	neutral	We know that FIFA will not change the dates for us, but we have plans for that too. We have plans that will help us deal with the hot weather in those two months.
576	negative	Víctor Hugo Cárdenas should ask himself what harm he might have caused his neighbors for them to condemn him.
246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
327	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,
1402	neutral	The U.S. policy review is very important, but in this very important year for Afghanistan, with the elections coming up, with the NATO summit coming up, with the new U.S. President Obama in Europe on a NATO summit, it is also very important that this alliance delivers in a very short term,
8	negative	If President Obama takes a look at what happened to President Bush, he won't want to,
1362	positive	I thought it was a great job by Spezza,

461	neutral	If an ally of al Qaeda and Iran comes to power in El Salvador, the national security interests of the United States will require certain immigration restrictions and controls over the flow over the four billion dollars in annual remittances sent from the U.S. back home to El Salvador.
454	neutral	The Indian doctors were screened and their qualifications checked before they left for the hospital. Their qualifications were approved by the Medical Council,
1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
277	neutral	The people we are fighting in Afghanistan, and the people they are sheltering in western Pakistan, pose a direct threat. Those are the men of 9/11, the people who killed Benazir Bhutto,
58	negative	One of the side-effects of quantitative easing will be a negative impact on pension funds and pensioners. Yet again pensioners are having to pay the price for Gordon Brown's age of irresponsibility.
343	positive	Rick Wagoner has worked for that company for 31 years, and he is a good man. He clearly is a sacrificial lamb,
683	neutral	What they have indicated quite clearly is that they are not prepared to accept any simplistic explanation or any attempts to blame the economic conditions on the Jamaica Labour Party government,
534	negative	The Dalai Lama has not served the religious harmony but instead repeatedly makes troubles,
848	neutral	I can 100 per cent categorically deny any knowledge that Mr Chambers had decided to take performance-enhancing drugs.

273	neutral	The truth is that Franklin Roosevelt passed those laws under similar circumstances, and from 1945 to 1974, we had an era where workers' wages and productivity was joined together,
1200	neutral	Oh no, come on - this is small beer in the NHS budget.
1446	neutral	&gt;Rangeen Dadfar Spanta addressed the media with Canadian counterpart Lawrence Cannon , whose government pledged 21 million Canadian dollars ( US$16 million ) to help rule of law in the militant-infested country. Afghanistan is determined to take more responsibilities in the fight on terrorism,
231	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
322	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,
1526	positive	Their kindness was exploited by the terrorists… Helping citizens - This is Israel Police's true calling, this is how commanders and officers educate officers. We will continue that tradition and protect the country everywhere,
109	positive	I thought it would be appropriate to play tonight, because no one has done more than Senator Ted Kennedy to help resolve the problems of Ireland,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins. My father is a descendent of the Gaon and the mitnagdim [opponents of Hassidism], and my mother is a descendent of the cousin of the Gaon, who was considered to have betrayed the Gaon.
1140	positive	We're very clear that to make progress we need to talk to Hamas, because they represent a big proportion of the Palestinian people,
715	positive	Whatever his transgressions, Fujimori is still remembered for his undeniable achievements. He inherited chaos and delivered economic and political order to Peru, which is no mean feat,
348	neutral	Here we are six months after the Wall Street bailout began and it's still the case that almost no loans are being made to [ordinary people on] main street,
403	neutral	This is in addition to the five million pounds (7.2 million dollars) that we have already given directly to the African Union for AMISOM,
1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
156	neutral	Can you believe I got a message from Michael Jackson?
815	neutral	They've had a good week, getting a great result against Real Madrid,
479	neutral	As in the rest of Europe, the Czech Republic is feeling the effects of the global economic and financial crisis, especially in the regions. The European Commission is working closely with the Czech authorities to ensure that they make the most of the EU structural and cohesion funds, in order to boost competitiveness and create jobs. In addition to reimbursing agreed project costs, the Commission will advance more than €1 billion in Cohesion Policy grants to support investment in the country in 2009; this i

1412	neutral	Secretary Gates will not be traveling to the NATO Summit next month as originally planned,
1174	negative	The police do nothing. When we first went to them and told them that spurious liquor was killing people here, they just laughed t us. They said they had all died their natural deaths. Now, we will make sure that this mafia is completely rooted out of this area,
1210	neutral	There can be no greater injury than the killing of one's spouse. The attempts to make the position of Mrs Hani irrelevant is completely out of context with our common law,
489	neutral	We have always supported him as a president of the European Commission, he has been a good president for the interests of Spain,
1159	neutral	It is ironic to link this convoy with Hamas though we're still unsure if there was a convoy bombed by airplanes,
354	neutral	We know about Deputy Dempsey now.
1461	neutral	Crude prices are up, I think, in a knee-jerk reaction to the news of Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy ship in the South China Sea,
718	negative	I was taught to loathe Manchester United, their fans, players, manager, kit-man, mascot, megastore-workers everyone associated with Old Trafford.
996	neutral	If we really want consumers to buy green, the sustainable choice must be an easy choice. Product information must be clear, and sustainable products must not be a luxury option. European retailers are in a unique position to help us get there. They are a part of consumers' everyday life and can have an immediate impact on the choices they make. That is why I am truly happy to launch the Forum today, alongside Commissioner Dimas. And I believe this is a good starting point for a concerted approach among reta
969	neutral	We all agree it was important that this takes effect at the next European Council in March. We will take a decision,

1115	neutral	Expanding the opening of the crossings to non-humanitarian aid is conditional on Hamas releasing Gilad Shalit,
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.

442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2

408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations.
