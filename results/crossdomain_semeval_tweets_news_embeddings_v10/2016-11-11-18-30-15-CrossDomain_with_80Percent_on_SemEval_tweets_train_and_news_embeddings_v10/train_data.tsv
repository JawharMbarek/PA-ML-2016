449	neutral	Fatah tries to draw Hamas to recognize the Israeli occupation by putting pressure on us that the commitments of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) must be respected,
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
193	neutral	I am sure we can work with Nawaz Sharif in strengthening the democratic process,
1533	positive	Washington thinks that process of regulation of Daqliq Qarabaq conflict should be held in parallel with normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations.

459	negative	Al-Qaeda is conducting attacks with no planning and no clear goals,
1369	neutral	We will do all we can to keep Andrei in Berlin.
1068	neutral	The Commission starts from the position that a Parliament which reflects the make-up of the nation it represents will result in better legislation and a higher degree of public confidence in the democratic process.
445	neutral	I firmly believe that voting along with Communists and the Social Democrats against the government is such an argument in favour of the end of their party membership that no one can question,
1146	neutral	The Shalit case is dependent on prisoners swap... He will never be released if the Israeli occupation does not release Palestinian prisoners whom Hamas wants free, whatever the consequence might be,
1406	neutral	Although their troops have been bravely fighting alongside ours in Afghanistan, it is welcome news to have them fully reintegrated in all NATO military matters and we look forward to working even more closely with them in the decades to come,
776	neutral	We must do our utmost to bringing internet technologies to all citizens of Europe. Internet technologies contribute to half of productivity growth in the EU, and the EU's Member States cannot afford their rural areas missing out on this potential, especially not in these times of economic crisis,
1469	positive	This government must not clear its table before Shalit is back home,
786	neutral	We have to seek a consensus among member states about the importance of having negotiations on a free trade agreement,
1185	neutral	I believe Ozawa will decide on his own fate. As secretary-general, I will make every effort to get the entire party together behind whatever that decision is and I pledge to work together with unity.

1297	negative	Google is great for Google but it's terrible for content providers.
666	positive	Its main purpose is to emphasize the inextricable links with our homeland, with the colossal riches created by our ancestors which we are now responsible for. The great experience accumulated by the Orthodox Church during many centuries is of great value for the present day generation. This experience inspires and encourages people,
742	negative	The results were tampered with 100 percent by Kurds and the Iraqi Islamic Party,
332	negative	Merrill Lynch secretly moved up the planned date to allocate bonuses and then richly rewarded their failed executives,
1381	negative	We should all be extremely worried that the Bank of England appears to have abandoned its core remit, which is to safeguard the nation against inflation. 'By providing massive monetary stimulus while inflation is still way above the two per cent target, the Bank of England is flying blind. 'Make no mistake, this will most likely mean a massive inflationary problem in years to come. 'This quantitative easing is a giant gamble, a leap in the dark, with taxpayers
1408	neutral	That decision stands: Ukraine and Georgia will eventually be members of NATO [...], but enlargement is a performance-based project, and the question of when depends on their performance,
104	negative	We came here 10 days ago to be a reminder that this window is closing and to bring the matter to a public test. We hoped that Prime Minister Ehud Olmert would take advantage of his last days in office to bring Gilad home. Unfortunately, we were wrong,

20	neutral	It is now of course up to the French parliament to state its position, but the president (Sarkozy) has clearly indicated that the process that should lead France to resume its full place (in NATO) has reached its final stage,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
306	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.
408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations. The Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deserve praise for sending a strong warning signal to the UN. Unfortunately, the efforts by the U.S. administration to ameliorate this process have not succeeded,
744	neutral	The Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II were trailblazers and true patriots,
229	neutral	I don't want to condemn Gen. Bashir nor condone impunity. It will be constructive to defer or suspend the ICC indictments on Gen Bashir,
325	neutral	We've made hundreds of billions of dollars of changes (from Obama's budget request) to make this work, to get down to the deficit goal and at the same time maintain the president's priorities in education, energy and healthcare,

1373	neutral	We've done well away from home in the UEFA Cup so I think we're strong and peaking at the right time of the season,
615	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,
724	negative	This is hypocrisy from David Cameron % not that long ago his policy commission was actively pushing for the complete deregulation of the mortgage market.
1436	neutral	I can say that Russia has not so far taken a decision to restore full-scale cooperation with NATO, above all in its military component,
1114	negative	I cannot accept the approach of some of Europe's leaders, who view Hamas as the symbol of responsibility and peace, failing to understand that it is a murderous terror organization preventing peace,
1467	positive	Just as the State of Israel is committed all the way to bringing back a captive soldier and locating a missing fighter, this is what we are doing these days to speed up the return of Gilad Shalit, national commitment is strong before you and your loved ones,
683	neutral	What they have indicated quite clearly is that they are not prepared to accept any simplistic explanation or any attempts to blame the economic conditions on the Jamaica Labour Party government,
232	negative	That is why arresting Beshir is needed, to stop the crimes,
1008	positive	As far as I am concerned the National Anthem should stay exactly as it is, which is fine. 'Secondly, those lines are so utterly banal that even an 11-year-old would disown them. 'I am perfectly happy to be British and perfectly happy with the National Anthem as it is. I certainly don't aspire to rewrite anything.
1319	neutral	I spoke with the President before putting forward my candidature in the Verkhovna Rada. The President told me that he intended to set forth my candidature. He expects me to continue the course towards European and Euro-Atlantic integration, that is, our strategic course,
1176	positive	There are perhaps 10, 20 (fighters) still left in the mountains. But hundreds of thousands of people celebrated Mohammed's birthday today,
1575	negative	Elisabeth's imprisonment was premeditated; Fritzl had been planning her imprisonment in the dungeon cellar for two to three months before he actually lured his daughter down there.
1182	neutral	This is an important step for us as a standalone business. It also confirms our determination as a team to steer Jaguar Land Rover through these extraordinary and challenging times, so that our business is ready to take advantage when the downturn finally ends.
404	neutral	there is a resolution by the African Union and there is an Arab summit in Doha. I believe they will push forward Arabs' ideas toward this topic.
1334	negative	However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,
30	neutral	Because he was voted for as [Putin's] successor, he has to maintain a balance between continuity and his liberal initiatives,
1069	neutral	The commission has received a proposal to extend decommissioning by Bulgaria. The Commission is assessing the proposal. It has not been approved,
1472	neutral	This government apparently won't bring back Gilad Shalit,

44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
868	neutral	We will reintroduce the National Women Development Policy adopted during the last Awami League government's tenure. We gave nomination to maximum number of women for contesting the December 29 polls,
295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

956	neutral	From the loan that we took up, EUR 5 bln from EU and EUR 1 bln from the World Bank are intended for the Finance Ministry. Not any EUR intended for the Finance Ministry and not any EUR from the money intended for BNR can go to salaries or bonuses. This money is for Romania,
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
460	negative	Its culture is extermist, is radical, is hostile, denies Israel's right to exist, and it belongs more in the camp of the Taliban and al Qaeda and the Moslem Brotherhoods of the world, all of which are very, very uncompromising. What can we do?

1113	negative	We will not allow Hamas to build new bunkers or use piping to build missiles,
