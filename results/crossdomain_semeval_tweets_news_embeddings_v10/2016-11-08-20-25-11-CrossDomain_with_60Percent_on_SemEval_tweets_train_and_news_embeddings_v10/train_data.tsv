1381	negative	We should all be extremely worried that the Bank of England appears to have abandoned its core remit, which is to safeguard the nation against inflation. 'By providing massive monetary stimulus while inflation is still way above the two per cent target, the Bank of England is flying blind. 'Make no mistake, this will most likely mean a massive inflationary problem in years to come. 'This quantitative easing is a giant gamble, a leap in the dark, with taxpayers
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue.

442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2

I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

1104	negative	Prime Minister (Robert Fico) is misusing the fact that SMK presides over the Office (UVO),
148	neutral	Our survey told us that the people of this country want a strong leader and a decisive government. When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,

681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition.

Once they are on board it is much easier to convince the international community that this government is not a radical-right government,
