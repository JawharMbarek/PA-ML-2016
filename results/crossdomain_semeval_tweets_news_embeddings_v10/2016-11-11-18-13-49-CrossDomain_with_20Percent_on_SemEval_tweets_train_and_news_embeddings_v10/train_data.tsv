343	positive	Rick Wagoner has worked for that company for 31 years, and he is a good man. He clearly is a sacrificial lamb,
1274	neutral	Is this the first step to Russia joining OPEC? Stay tuned,
350	neutral	The crude oil market is watching two fronts: the stock markets and the dollar, (and) right now crude prices are up as Wall Street is gaining,
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,
1198	neutral	In England, 89% of prescription items are dispensed for free, the remainder provide valuable income to the NHS, of £437 million in 2009/10, which goes towards to the safety and speed of healthcare. But we are making the system fairer. Cancer patients will be eligible for free prescriptions from April 1 this year and we're looking at how we can do the same for people with long-term conditions.
1130	positive	Our movement rejects any agreement until all political prisoners in the West Bank are getting released and until the security apparatuses stop chasing Hamas members in the West Bank,
913	neutral	I think that the best way to judge movies is, like, 10 years after they're released. I think they should actually do the awards that way. I think they should have done the Academy Awards this year for movies from 1998,
27	negative	Even in December [President Medvedev] said that Parliament was not working hard enough, that it was only undertaking 30% of the measures set down to tackle the financial crisis. He didn't name Vladimir Putin personally, of course, but still…
1043	neutral	I have been the member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh for last three years and this state is not new for me,
268	neutral	This 90-mile single-track rail line now has only two passing loops on the entire length and Network Rail can give no date for the necessary repairs to the loops at Llandovery, Llandeilo and Knighton.
1126	neutral	It is important that we encourage Hamas to accept the PLO platform,
769	negative	All of this to-ing and fro-ing about who said what and when about Sir Fred Goodwin's pension casts further doubt on the competence of the minister's handling of this matter and on the conduct of the directors and the chairman. 'They should never have allowed Sir Fred to behave in the way that he did. 'Instead of this demeaning haggle over the size of the pension, it should be stopped.
493	neutral	It is for the U.S. to decide how best to regulate Internet gambling in its market, but this must be done in a way that fully respects WTO obligations. I am hopeful that we can find a swift, negotiated solution to this issue,
1161	neutral	There is a drop in rocket attacks and only one rocket from a small organization was fired in recent days. There are two reasons for this: Hamas is not interested in an escalation that will result in another confrontation with Israel, Hamas is making arrests before attacks are carried out. Also, Hamas signed an agreement with the Islamic Jihad saying it would avoid such attacks in the near future,
15	positive	This was a great meeting where we discussed the key issues surrounding climate change policy with international leaders, such as former Prime Minister Tony Blair , who have already gained valuable insight on how such policies may affect manufacturing and economic opportunities,
1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
1564	positive	I heard about a meeting to soon be held between Finance Minister Mohammad Chatah and Development and Liberation bloc MP Ali Hassan Khalil. This is the right track… because Chatah should be informed about projects to be implemented,

1179	positive	He (Tendulkar) is an amazing batsman. The kind of shots he plays is amazing,
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
1373	neutral	We've done well away from home in the UEFA Cup so I think we're strong and peaking at the right time of the season,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
278	neutral	I've had two excellent meetings with President Obama,
1187	neutral	The law firm of Orum&Roth LLC is engaged in a campaign to notify potential infringers about Card Activation's patent. Notifying a party about the existence of the patent is the first step in attempting to obtain a license agreement. The firm is also engaged in performing due diligence to determine the method used by each potential infringer and to document that method. The firm then generally engages in communications about the patent either directly with a party or with that party's outside counsel. Th
852	neutral	The persecution of the opposition is beginning, and I'm sure that Rosales won't be the last to go to jail,
1006	neutral	The Kremlin's actions are [designed to] scare the governors,
787	neutral	I trust that the EU member states will deal with this according to the renewed consensus on enlargement, which is the basis of the EU's enlargement policy as decided in December 2006, and subsequently in the European Councils ever since,
965	neutral	The Gospel According to Jesus Christ,
383	neutral	A foreign element was almost certainly involved. It could be India, Afghanistan, the Tamil Tigers,
1533	positive	Washington thinks that process of regulation of Daqliq Qarabaq conflict should be held in parallel with normalization of Turkish-Armenian relations. As co-chairs of OSCE Minsk Group we made proposals basing on Madrid principles. I think we have achieved certain progress in Armenian-Azerbaijani relations,
844	neutral	It [JLP] will be disappointed that profits are down so much, but M&S is going to be way down. John Lewis still has pricing power and is one of the few retailers that has.
117	negative	My daughter is 18 months old and if you asked me what will happen first -- will she get her pension or will Zuma be prosecuted -- I will say she will get her pension.
1291	negative	The costs of badly run NASA projects are paid for with cutbacks or delays in NASA projects that didn't go over budget,
985	neutral	The Guardian Council is the sole authority allowed to interpret the Constitution, therefore the president's involvement in such issues is against the law,
910	neutral	&gt;Pfizer Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. But the key player today is the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), with its Bilateral Collaborative Research Support programme worth 238 million Swedish Kroners (US$27 million). In 1999 Sida started working with Makerere to help it reach a position where it could set about finding its own solutions to Uganda's problems. Initially, the agency worked with individual researchers and faculties. But a bigger idea emerged: that the changes they were h
1183	positive	I enthusiastically support the Senate confirmation of David Hamilton for U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals,
1441	positive	the problem of Afghanistan cannot be resolved in one day. That's why we need a permanent table for consultations between NATO, Russia and those nations contributing to stabilization in the medium-term.
535	negative	The Dalai Lama's ever-changing stances are against the historical and religious traditions,
187	neutral	After Netanyahu and Lieberman settled the future government's guidelines for regional talks, which focus on toppling Hamas' regime and refusing to commit Israel to a two-state solution, Labor has no reason to stay on,
925	neutral	Vote for selecting between the Japanese representative (to the agency) Yukiya Amano and the South African representative Abdul Samad Minty will be held at the IAEA board of governors' extraordinary session on 26-27 March,
1512	neutral	The facts revealed today reflect the way the U.S. government has consistently tried to cover up the truth of Binyam Mohamed's torture,
636	neutral	Our biggest problem at the moment is who is going to give us money. If the money is available who should it be given to, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Ministry of Finance? Should it be given to commercial banks or someone else?
1079	neutral	The candidacy of Mr Moussavi and the [possible] withdrawal of Khatami will significantly raise the possibility of Ahmadi-Nejad [winning] the election.
1157	neutral	It is ironic to link this convoy with Hamas though we're still unsure if there was a convoy bombed by airplanes,
495	positive	This is yet another good news story for a Fine Gael team that is growing from strength to strength.
839	neutral	This is a positive move, which I hope now draws a line under the debate and allows the British Olympic Association to move forward with planning for 2012.
1136	neutral	The talks touched upon Hamas point of view regarding all topics related to the Palestinian situation, indicating that the delegation understood the most attitudes. Hamdan pointed out that Hamas has an extensive network of relations on the Arab and international level.
262	neutral	We intend to raise this violation of the UN Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the UN,
1296	neutral	We are older than Google, Slashdot, or Facebook, and I'm not aware of any Web hosts that were organized in 1995 and are still privately owned and operating under the original management,
1133	negative	It worries me and it should also worry Hamas. That is why I would recommend to Hamas to quickly make a deal. They will not get better terms than these,
622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.
183	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,
1490	neutral	Work must continue, and Israel must provide maps showing the location of such bombs. The UN and the UNIFIL have called on Israel more than once to make these maps available,
1212	positive	We also look forward to the committee established by the Human Rights Council to assume its tasks and to present other report on the results of the investigation and further to the results of the International Fact-finding Mission established by the Arab League for the same purpose.
362	neutral	These figures show that despite all Harriet Harman's claims about the Labour Government being female friendly they have failed to address this most basic problem.
468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,
179	neutral	We had a meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party recently and there is nothing to suggest that Atiku Abubakar is not a member of the AC. He has not told us he is leaving our party. We asked him several times and he told us that he is still in AC.
789	neutral	It is clear that today's outcome will not kill off the proposals to extend copyright term, but rather that member states need more time to consider that details of the proposal and reach an agreement,
497	neutral	Bob Hawke is nowhere near as Irish as I am,
77	neutral	We are going ahead with the operations and we are on the right track, but it's not yet official that Beckham will stay at Milan,
757	negative	I think Scudamore is an absolute disgrace,
1417	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense, I do not expect Obama to make any...negative statement,
347	neutral	Here we are six months after the Wall Street bailout began and it's still the case that almost no loans are being made to [ordinary people on] Main Street,
590	neutral	Today I issue a call that responsibility must also fall on the European Union.
446	neutral	I think so. If there is continuity in the negotiations from the government parties, then the Social Democrats are interested in a very quick solution, by the end of this week,
1186	positive	I am willing to work with Your Excellency and carry forward the Sino-Pakistan Strategic Partnership of Cooperation to a new high.

725	negative	How can David Cameron talk about fairness when he is still committed to a tax cut for millionaire's estates, won't back our £1.2bn help for the unemployed to get back into work, and wants to cut Sure Start?
334	negative	raise significant questions about what information Merrill Lynch and Bank of America executives shared with federal officials that oversaw the Merrill acquisition by Bank of America,
114	negative	Lower-income people are very aware of the national debate, and are therefore pretty informed. This election is about whether you think Zuma is a hero or a villain,
1033	neutral	We expect the ECB to cut interest rates by a further 50 basis points to one percent in April,
840	neutral	It is the law of the land and it cannot be altered for anybody. Sidhu's case was far different from Sanjay Dutt.
264	neutral	We are about to set up a high-level delegation to go to New York to lobby the UN Security Council,
1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,

92	positive	I have no doubt that with Netanyahu's government here we will have good and positive relations with the Obama administration,
328	neutral	In a nutshell, it is 11 years since the fixed-line business was supposedly open to competition. After 11 years, France Telecom still has an overwhelming position.
1410	neutral	nothing today justifies re-entering the Nato military command
1566	neutral	Rtd Gen Zvinavashe was a committed member of our party Zanu-PF and also of the army. He was very loyal, a military strategist and a hero of excellence. He also left an indelible legacy in education by building schools, which is an indication that Rtd Gen Zvinavashe wanted the people to also get access to education,
421	neutral	The United Nations is deeply concerned over a lack of direct information from his abductors on the condition of John and has reason to believe he could now be very seriously ill,
1394	neutral	While not shying away from the serious differences of opinion that remain between NATO and Russia, in particular about Georgia, we also acknowledge that we have obvious common interests with Russia: Afghanistan is one, but counterterrorism and the fight against WMD proliferation are others,
274	positive	She always fought for the rights and uplift of the poor and the government will engage all available resources to accomplish the vision of Benazir Bhutto,
1391	neutral	NATO has taken on a United Nations mission and NATO must succeed or I do think the future of NATO as we've known it is in considerable doubt,
1567	neutral	Rtd Gen Zvinavashe was a committed member of our party Zanu-PF and also of the army. He was very loyal, a military strategist and a hero of excellence.

1292	neutral	NASA decided to hold an election to name its new room at the international space station and the clear winner is Stephen Colbert ,
374	neutral	With South Africa having just concluded its Human Rights Day celebrations, it beggars belief that our government would go out of its way to block the Dalai Lama -- an apostle of peace, who is revered throughout the world for his unwavering commitment to non-violence, human rights and cultural freedom -- from entering the country,
7	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
259	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
333	negative	Today's decision in the Bank of America case is a victory for taxpayers. Let the sun shine in. Justice Fried's decision will now lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding the $3.6 billion in premature bonuses Merrill Lynch rushed out in early December,
189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked. Do you support or oppose these positions?
942	neutral	There is no quick or easy solution to protect clubs from the global crisis ... but one proposal which seems to be gaining a consensus is limiting professional contracts like we have already in the Champions League,
471	neutral	were not Al Qaeda facilities.... Abu Zubaydah had an agreement with Bin Laden to conduct reciprocal recruiting efforts.

1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,
247	neutral	The difference with the European Parliament is they are not like the British Parliament, where you can change legislation. All they do is consult.

36	neutral	It's time for Gordon Brown and his colleagues to break the spell Peter seems to have over the higher echelons of Government.

The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,
246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
730	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
1002	neutral	This is a one-time dip into the National Insurance Medical Branch Fund,
941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.
401	neutral	If the African Union is to play its full part, it must have means to support future short-term operational deployments, and the capacity to develop the essential capabilities necessary for the long term,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,
1170	neutral	On Iran, we agree with him that Iran has the right to develop civil nuclear power provided that it cooperates fully with the IAEA and complies with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
216	neutral	I was present when Prime Minister Tsvangirai gave the number (US$5 billion), but it was just a number given. There's a document that actually splits the immediate costs over the next 10 months into two amounts of about a billion dollars each,
607	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,
422	negative	I called Mihai, I talked to him; he said that certainly, if the offer comes from the party leader, then he agrees. I talked to Mircea Geoana, and he said that he would contact him, in a first stage. I found out, after a week, talking to Mihai, that he had not been contacted by anyone,
1526	positive	Their kindness was exploited by the terrorists… Helping citizens - This is Israel Police's true calling, this is how commanders and officers educate officers. We will continue that tradition and protect the country everywhere,
1248	neutral	There's a lot of credence given to OPEC cuts and the persistently low US refinery utilization rate,
295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
1497	neutral	it is time for Myanmar proved to ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the world that road map to democracy could proceed,
432	neutral	A gas pipeline is groundwork for our economy. It will link our countries more closely than the Trasncaucasian Highway. I met with Alexei Miller at Gazprom the other day, and he told me that Gazprom would keep its promise regardless, and that the gas pipeline would be commissioned in the third quarter of this year,

1112	neutral	I arrived in Indian Wells earlier this week and I am eager to get back out on court,
1483	positive	In the context of what we're doing, Secretary Geithner was notified, he has said, last week. As he reported to the rest of us, he moved aggressively and immediately, aggressively and immediately, to recoup whatever could be legally recouped. He recognized that you can't just abrogate contracts willy-nilly, but he moved to do what could be done.
988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,
1406	neutral	Although their troops have been bravely fighting alongside ours in Afghanistan, it is welcome news to have them fully reintegrated in all NATO military matters and we look forward to working even more closely with them in the decades to come,
1541	neutral	But I was asleep! So he recorded a little answerphone message and Jack (husband Jack Tweed) played it to me,
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1236	neutral	There was a slight improvement to the batsmen other than Sehwag,

This provided 180 temporary bed spaces.

34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Pakistan's leaders are working very, very hard to try to reach an agreement that will bring elements of the government together in unity and allow them to go forward,
1140	positive	We're very clear that to make progress we need to talk to Hamas, because they represent a big proportion of the Palestinian people,
25	neutral	The fact that Hillary presents a critical assessment of Senator Clinton's political background, character, and fitness for office does not convert the movie ... into an appeal to vote against Senator Clinton,
933	neutral	But look at the recent political dynamics. Golkar wants to support its own presidential candidate, and Kalla has declared himself as that candidate. I would have been very embarrassed had I said I would surely pair up with him again,
717	positive	By a long way it is Ferguson's best squad. I really do believe that potentially this is best team that Manchester United has had,
496	neutral	Fine Gael welcome him wholeheartedly and unreservedly . . . that welcome extends also from our two sitting TDs in Galway East.

73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.
280	neutral	Go wash that avocado tree, Mr. Obama, go wash that avocado tree (...) whoever wants to can translate it to him in creole, I have nothing more to say. Don't say later I began to throw stones,

848	neutral	I can 100 per cent categorically deny any knowledge that Mr Chambers had decided to take performance-enhancing drugs.
1286	neutral	&gt;United Nations has said, calling for better management to alleviate water shortages.

With increasing shortages, good governance is more than ever essential for water management. Combating poverty also depends on our ability to invest in this resource,
1303	negative	I do not have any medals thanks to Tudjman. The knowledge of he who calls upon me is questionable, and should know that he needs to protect the law.

1072	neutral	It is a very pragmatic country and while it may be arguing with the UK about Alexander Litvinenko [the former KGB agent killed in London] it doesn't mean that they won't be closely watching what the government is doing.

1137	positive	We need to talk to Hamas to make progress (toward peace) because they represent a big proportion of the Palestinians.
1073	positive	It seems the IRS and Treasury Department went out of their way to knock out an emerging, effective and evenhanded way to collect tax debt that the IRS will otherwise never collect,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February. On the one hand, the ministry needed to pay out its outstanding debt to business operators, the now famous 2 billion euros, and then it needed to offset the almost 7?percent deficit in the revenue projected and revenue collected,

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate.

93	neutral	This is a fundamental choice Bibi [Likud leader Binyamin Netanyahu] must make - will he go with the Right, or with us? [A national unity government] should give an equal partnership and have diplomatic understandings, otherwise there will be no deal,

876	neutral	and sparked panic. Witnesses told WINS radio that the situation was compounded when a man leapt from a car and began grabbing women's purses. A New York Police Department official said two women and a man were arrested on charges of inciting to riot and disorderly conduct. It is so important to me to redefine beauty and make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to pursue their dream,
45	negative	Gordon Brown's speech shows that he is in complete denial about how wrong he has been for 12 years, and his own responsibility for the banking crisis.

Before, I respected the principle that the state must not be sued, even when Miloševi? stole from us [Radicals] in Kosovo taking 50 mandates, but now the situation is different,
1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more.

40	negative	Gordon Brown seemed to offer a lot of warm words but very few hard plans to fight the recession which has engulfed the world economy and his government.
681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition.
