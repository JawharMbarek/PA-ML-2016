1270	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1020	negative	We must acknowledge that most in the financial community, including those of us at the Federal Reserve, failed to either detect or act upon the tell-tale signs of financial system excess,

824	neutral	This has been a huge challenge. When I look back at how far we have come in such a short space of time, it really is very impressive. Here, Formula One has taken on the role of technology accelerator for series production cars of the future.
290	negative	Today's news that President Obama will open the door to direct taxpayer funds for embryonic stem-cell research that encourages the destruction of human embryos is a slap in the face to Americans who believe in the dignity of all human life,
605	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,
333	negative	Today's decision in the Bank of America case is a victory for taxpayers. Let the sun shine in. Justice Fried's decision will now lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding the $3.6 billion in premature bonuses Merrill Lynch rushed out in early December,
281	neutral	The connection that Barack Obama has to the black community and the connection George Bush has to the evangelical community began long before they began running for president. It was a natural and deep connection, politics aside,

1075	neutral	We have spent a long time with Pakistan Muslim League-N and we want to resolve all the issues with the PML-N in an amicable manner.
970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008. I urge the Government to focus on this opportunity to provide quick aid to
139	negative	Peres established the reactor in Dimona and developed Israel's nuclear weapons program...

610	neutral	I have been hearing from the European Union that the priority is diversification...of routes, supplies, sources. But the declaration...would only enhance the dominant role of Ukraine as a transit country.
260	neutral	No ICC or Security Council or any other party will change our path or touch an eyelash in our eye,
725	negative	How can David Cameron talk about fairness when he is still committed to a tax cut for millionaire's estates, won't back our £1.2bn help for the unemployed to get back into work, and wants to cut Sure Start?

690	neutral	Brother Salam Fayyad has submitted his resignation to us in order to support and strengthen the Palestinian dialogue on forming a government,
346	neutral	We are the only city where Wall Street is just a subway stop away from Main Street. White-collar crime, as we have seen, affects our pensions, affects our not-for-profit institutions and it affects our businesses,
1309	neutral	 either this guy committed perjury on behalf of his client, Dr. Aribert Heim, or Ruediger Heim,
159	neutral	The talks with Clinton would tackle the program of the Israeli government,
188	negative	This is a personal-political matter on Lieberman's part. He is leading this proposal only to enable the 200,000 Russians who immigrated to Israel and then emigrated to take part in elections and get their vote at the polling station.
1124	negative	We definitely don't want to see the goodwill of the international community exploited by Hamas and serve Hamas's extremist purposes,

1142	neutral	As I said before, we don't want Hamas to recognize Israel, but we really want a government that can be accepted by the West and the international Quartet that could help end the current blockade imposed on our people,
238	positive	They have genuine world-class players and where once they relied on Steven Gerrard there's now Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso and Jamie Carragher. When they beat us at Anfield earlier this season Gerrard and Torres weren't even playing.
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
1207	positive	Twelve years ago it was not uncommon for patients to have to wait well over 18 months for an operation. Achieving the shortest waits since NHS records began is a tremendous achievement for staff and I congratulate them for all their hard work.

Denver's Chauncey Billups, fouled by Hill with 5.4 seconds remaining to prevent the Nuggets' from attempting a tying 3-pointer, made two free throws to cut the Suns' lead to 116-115. The Nuggets fouled Steve Nash on the inbound play, and he made both foul shots with 3.9 seconds left. Carmelo Anthony, who led the Nuggets with 29 points, missed a 3-pointer from the left wing in the final second. Billups had 20 points. It's a
1510	neutral	If we see the Varun Gandhi issue, his (Kumar's) secular conduct is in the clear,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,

He also left an indelible legacy in education by building schools, which is an indication that Rtd Gen Zvinavashe wanted the people to also get access to education,
224	negative	The law is clear. President al Bashir must appear before the ICC to defend himself. If he refuses to do so, the Sudanese authorities must ensure that he is arrested and surrendered immediately to the ICC,

1130	positive	Our movement rejects any agreement until all political prisoners in the West Bank are getting released and until the security apparatuses stop chasing Hamas members in the West Bank,
1238	neutral	We have been quite comfortable with 3-1 combination. When it comes to three seamers and one spinner, we have part timers who have proved that they can get wickets in Test cricket also. You have Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and Sachin Tendulkar who can bowl if it is turning,

1394	neutral	While not shying away from the serious differences of opinion that remain between NATO and Russia, in particular about Georgia, we also acknowledge that we have obvious common interests with Russia: Afghanistan is one, but counterterrorism and the fight against WMD proliferation are others,

469	neutral	If the process of integrating . . . members into the state security services and other institutions is frustrated, as it looks very much it will be, then this will leave a huge opportunity for Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has been down but never out, to get back into the game,

243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.
867	neutral	I do not know whether COAS General Kayani persuaded President Asif Ali Zardari to restore the judges, but I am sure some people must have persuaded him.
183	neutral	These are methods that, in my opinion, Saakashvili has used many times already,

41	positive	It is right [of Mr Brown] to remind Americans that we need to work together against protectionism, in defeating terrorism and in combating climate change.
273	neutral	The truth is that Franklin Roosevelt passed those laws under similar circumstances, and from 1945 to 1974, we had an era where workers' wages and productivity was joined together,
769	negative	All of this to-ing and fro-ing about who said what and when about Sir Fred Goodwin's pension casts further doubt on the competence of the minister's handling of this matter and on the conduct of the directors and the chairman. 'They should never have allowed Sir Fred to behave in the way that he did. 'Instead of this demeaning haggle over the size of the pension, it should be stopped.
1038	positive	The Information Society brings us countless new opportunities and it is our duty to ensure that it develops on a solid and sustainable base.
