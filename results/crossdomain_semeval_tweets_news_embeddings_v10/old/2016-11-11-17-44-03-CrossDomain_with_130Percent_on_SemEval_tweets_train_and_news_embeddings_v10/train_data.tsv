If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov

1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.

Turkey currently has a population of 70 millions. The Muslim country will rule the EU; will have the most Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), the most votes. It will tell everyone what to do and what not to do. I will tell you what they are going to do - they will build mosques all over, they will place a minaret on top of the Eiffel Tower. Thi

1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
378	negative	Minister Jeff Radebe has been warned on numerous occasions that he needs to consult,

1557	positive	I am proud to represent RBC on the PGA Tour-they have shown a tremendous commitment to our Tour and to golf in Canada,
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission. It is a test of Barroso's courage and conviction. Today should be an important day in the history of international financial markets - but we shall see if the current conservative European Commission is capable of taking the recommended steps.
997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders.

588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances

569	neutral	The UPA is no longer united ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. It has proved to be an opportunistic alliance, unlike the NDA (National democratic Alliance) which is united and strong,
1438	neutral	More US and NATO soldiers are now (getting) killed in Afghanistan. Their tanks are destroyed and even (their) helicopters are shot down,
1189	neutral	Orszag told reporters. Deficits so big put upward pressure on interest rates as the government offers more attractive interest rates to attract borrowers. I think deficits of 5 percent (of GDP) are unsupportable,

1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training. It will also threaten the care that patients receive because there will not be the same continuity of care and because smaller surgical teams will have to be shut down.
