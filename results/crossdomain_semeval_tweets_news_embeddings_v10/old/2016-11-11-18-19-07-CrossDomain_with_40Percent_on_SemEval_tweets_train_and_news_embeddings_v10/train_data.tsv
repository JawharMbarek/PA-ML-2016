786	neutral	We have to seek a consensus among member states about the importance of having negotiations on a free trade agreement,
482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov

612	neutral	We are still a weak country, under political and international pressure, and we had mistakes like the escape of Goran Hadzic, but the problem that the Hague has needs to be sought in the court itself, not in Belgrade
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
59	negative	This is a direct result of Gordon Brown's reckless failure to provide enough prison places. Releasing criminals early has already resulted in three murders and over a thousand other crimes. It is unacceptable and Ministers must scrap this policy now.
625	negative	Chelsea boss Guus Hiddink has had some great results but sooner or later he'll have to lose.
39	negative	Gordon Brown is deeply implicated in the mistakes of the past. Even if he won't apologise, he can't escape them.

1537	neutral	Bastrykin praised highly the joint work of the SKP main investigation department in the Southern Federal District, the Federal Security Service and the Interior Ministry, which unmasked all members of the criminal group involved in the foresaid crimes. Three of them were arrested. Another six were put on the international wanted list,
1334	negative	However, Chairman Steele's reversal this evening and his apology to Limbaugh proves the unfortunate point that Limbaugh is the leading force behind the Republican Party, its politics and its obstruction of President Obama's agenda in Washington,

26	positive	This cohesion around the party of the majority, its chairman (Prime Minister) Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev... this support is crucial today when the economic crisis is trying to grip Russia,
48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
97	negative	I am not afraid of Benjamin Netanyahu. I won't serve as a fig leaf to anyone, and I won't be anyone's dead weight. We will be the counter force that will prevent the formation of a narrow right wing government, and ensure the establishment of a real government that will take care of the Israeli people,
668	negative	Sadly, every week we see businesses down-sizing and others going to the wall and more people losing their jobs. What we need is real leadership from James Purnell (Work and Pensions Secretary) and this tired Labour Government.
1450	positive	I want my first win as team principal and my first world championship more than I realised. And I certainly don't want to be the man who fails to deliver the championship for Lewis Hamilton.

589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1046	negative	After having picked up snowdrops for five years, Basescu should be sent about his business on the occasion of the elections, and our duty within the party is to find the best formula of counter-candidate for Basescu,

1331	neutral	Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer,
1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.

212	positive	I agree with Bob Brown when he said a deeply flawed scheme is worse than no scheme.
333	negative	Today's decision in the Bank of America case is a victory for taxpayers. Let the sun shine in. Justice Fried's decision will now lift the shroud of secrecy surrounding the $3.6 billion in premature bonuses Merrill Lynch rushed out in early December,
969	neutral	We all agree it was important that this takes effect at the next European Council in March. We will take a decision,

350	neutral	The crude oil market is watching two fronts: the stock markets and the dollar, (and) right now crude prices are up as Wall Street is gaining,
1178	neutral	Murr opposed the obstruction of the presidential elections. He supported Bkirki and its principles, which were violated. The development of his position led to rapprochement. However, this possibility does not mean that we authorized MP Murr to form alliances in the Metn. His vision of the [electoral] battle in the Metn is different from ours,
1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,
653	negative	The Supreme Court represented the last hope that Parwiz Kambakhsh would receive a fair hearing, but once again justice was denied,

43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
1428	neutral	The assumption made in our focus on Europe was that there would be no invasions of anyone's land borders. Well, that turned upside down. And that created an angst, a sense of tension among many of the NATO nations,
