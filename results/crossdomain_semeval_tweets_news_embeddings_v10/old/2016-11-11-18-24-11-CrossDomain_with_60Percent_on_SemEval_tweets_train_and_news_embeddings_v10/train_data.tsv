44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
54	negative	Gordon Brown is spending taxpayers' money on the latest digital gimmicks... but can't be bothered to give out a simple email address.

1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists
138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,

1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more.

123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue.

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?

128	negative	I am ready to welcome Tadic as president of Serbia if he agrees to come to the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust.
