980	neutral	Riquelme, I need him in the final 20 metres so he can link with (Carlos) Tevez, (Sergio) Aguero and Lionel Messi and peel off an opponent. I like it when he uses his speed to spray around decisive passes and also get on the scoresheet. If he's not doing that he is of no use to me,
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

1245	neutral	We will continue to be surprised on the bearish side by the data that's coming out - this keeps the demand deterioration argument very much alive, and pushes the OPEC production cuts to the backburner, precluding OPEC from becoming a significant force in this market,

448	negative	Now there will be efforts to come up with an excuse not to register the dangerous candidates -- primarily Nemtsov and Lebedev. They might let Lugovoi in, although that, of course, would be a bit of a scandal for the election,

1466	neutral	right from the very beginning that the truce and Shalit would be separate tracks
185	positive	John Warner has embodied the qualities that are our Nation's national greatest honor--integrity, independence, fairness, civility, and strength. Throughout his lifetime of service, he has been an unyielding advocate for causes and policies that embody those qualities. In all of his work, he has upheld the tradition of the distinguished and valuable leaders and patriots from Virginia who have shaped our country over the last three centuries. That is what our country needs in the Senate, and that is what our

490	negative	Talk of a Grand Strategy betrays the real intentions of the European Commission. 'The idea that we might turn our military bases over to the EU, for projects the British people have never given their assent to, is a twisted fantasy.
402	neutral	This is in addition to the five million pounds (7.2 million dollars) that we have already given directly to the African Union for AMISOM,
1210	neutral	There can be no greater injury than the killing of one's spouse. The attempts to make the position of Mrs Hani irrelevant is completely out of context with our common law,
1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.
1368	positive	This merger follows Reliance Industries' philosophy of creating enduring value for all our shareholders. It is a significant step in our goal to be among the largest global corporations
228	neutral	No one is above the law. If you are charged with a crime, you must stand up and face those charges in a court of law. President Al-Bashir will have the opportunity to do this before the International Criminal Court,
1119	neutral	We are not in a hurry. We have already chosen the Hamas leaders who will be represented in the five reconciliation committees. After we finish our consultations we will announce the final names,

827	neutral	The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities,
937	neutral	There was always a dream in my head of a possible Champions League or FA Cup final but the physios put the kybosh on that every time I mentioned it. So my comeback target is going to be pre-season for the start of next season,
1545	negative	When it comes to the banks squandering their customers' money ... I have discovered that it wasn't only Sir Fred who was getting money off RBS, it was also the right honourable member opposite who got £30,000 off the Royal Bank of Scotland for just two after-dinner speeches.

916	neutral	I hope that Ed Miliband has taken steps to ensure that there is no conflict of interest. 'While the publication of the list of ministers
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
255	neutral	Both China and Russia participate in the genocide war in Darfur, because Beijing sells arms and military vehicles to Khartoum and Russian pilots take part in the aerial bombardment and in starving the civilian population. The UN Security Council must take a stand on this issue.
982	neutral	If it is suggested -- as I believe that it is -- that I was involved in any conversations, the ective of which was to manipulate the National Prosecuting Authority or use it as a tool to frustrate Zuma's ambition to occupy the highest office in the land by prosecuting him, I am confident that, if any authentic record of my conversations with whomsoever is produced, no evidence would be found that would implicate me in such a conspiracy,
1240	neutral	Congressman Jefferson is at present being tried in the USA and Atiku had never been indicted on the matter,
1149	neutral	A new language toward the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening toward Hamas, it's a matter of time,

1043	neutral	I have been the member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh for last three years and this state is not new for me,

1015	neutral	After the rained-out game we've got to win, Dans (Vettori) told us it's a must-win game,
340	positive	They are bailing out just about anybody that shows up and says they need cash. The public has grown weary of it and instead of throwing a banker to the wolves they have decided to throw Wagoner to the wolves,
1282	negative	such a conspiracy will become counterproductive and boomerang on the Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati.

40	negative	Gordon Brown seemed to offer a lot of warm words but very few hard plans to fight the recession which has engulfed the world economy and his government.
1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,
10	neutral	This is the PM who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto,
2	neutral	The new U.S. president, who came to office on the slogan of bringing change in the policies of the Bush administration, speaks of unconditional commitment to defend Israel's security,
978	neutral	That has always been the Green Party position before entering government and that is still our position,
1217	neutral	national elections held no earlier than 20 August will allow ISAF to provide the right security conditions in support of the [Afghan National Security Forces].

99	negative	I'm delighted that the environment ministers have basically defied president Barroso and upheld the rights of individual countries to maintain their GMO bans,
1403	neutral	The U.S. policy review is very important, but in this very important year for Afghanistan, with the elections coming up, with the NATO summit coming up, with the new U.S. President Obama in Europe on a NATO summit, it is also very important that this alliance delivers in a very short term,
1457	positive	This is a dream come true for 11 of our member countries. It will surely help to lift the bar of football in these countries. My sincere hope is that the governments and business organisations join with us in this FIFA initiative that will take the sport to even greater heights
370	neutral	We have tremendous confidence in Secretary Geithner , and we are working with the committees of jurisdiction in order to get nominees both up to Capitol Hill and through the process of getting them into government,
1051	negative	The commonplace dodge between PSD and PDL, but especially the reelection of Traian Basescu are two major reasons for PNL to close ranks and to position ourselves as the only alternative to the current (non)governance,

1362	positive	I thought it was a great job by Spezza,
585	neutral	The European Union attaches the utmost importance to the holding of free and inclusive elections in Afghanistan. The elections are essential to guarantee the participation of the people of Afghanistan in the democratic process of state-building,

1126	neutral	It is important that we encourage Hamas to accept the PLO platform,
1418	neutral	NATO is no longer the organisation some people speak of. Forty years ago, General de Gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation, an organisation erected against the Warsaw pact and led exclusively by the United States,
833	neutral	It is said that Pawar has friends in all states. But it should be kept in mind that all his friends too are eyeing for the top slot and are not expected to clear ground for him for prime ministership (if UPA comes to power),
663	neutral	We will accept the Supreme Court's decision whatever it may be
1461	neutral	Crude prices are up, I think, in a knee-jerk reaction to the news of Chinese vessels harassing a U.S. Navy ship in the South China Sea,
353	neutral	I wish to express my sincere condolences to the families, friends and comrades of the two soldiers who were tragically murdered last night (Saturday) and those who were injured. My thoughts are with them all at this extremely difficult time. Northern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said there must not be any retaliation for the attack. He said:
304	neutral	The budget President Obama has proposed isn't the same-old document Washington has come to expect year after year,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
153	neutral	I think this a reaction to what happened in the elections last year. Even though Chavez's party did well, it lost the big states,
964	neutral	We examined the monastery and other ects. The impression is that there will be a lot of work to do here. We think that the volume of work is comparable to the restoration of the Kremlin or the construction of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral,
457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
339	negative	We are left to look back and say that Wagoner's appointment as both chairman and CEO in 2003 was little more than an act to ensure the dynasty of GM boardroom arrogance and failure continued,
256	neutral	We plan to discuss (the duration) at a Security Council meeting in six months,
992	neutral	I had discussed about the plans with Sourav after the first IPL season got over. Shahrukh Khan has given me a freehand in cricketing matters

314	neutral	I heard from the president (Obama) that he wanted to improve relations with Russia,
645	negative	Only an NGO like Amnesty International that has no political responsibility has allowed itself to make such allegations based on very partial enquiries and to launch a call to the UN on the basis of partial testimonies and newspaper clippings is totally irresponsible,
6	negative	The responsibility for that lies first and foremost with North Korea and second with President Bush and his senior advisers, who did not empower Ambassador Hill to engage in direct talks with Pyongyang until after the North had withdrawn from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, exported nuclear technology to Syria, and tested a nuclear bomb,
619	negative	I am not given the floor in Moscow so why not use some of my resources and knowledge to challenge in another city where they still have the chance of a fair election? People are not happy with the way they are being treated as far as the Olympics are concerned so it won't be easy to put a United Russia stamp on this election.
460	negative	Its culture is extermist, is radical, is hostile, denies Israel's right to exist, and it belongs more in the camp of the Taliban and al Qaeda and the Moslem Brotherhoods of the world, all of which are very, very uncompromising. What can we do?
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
1006	neutral	The Kremlin's actions are [designed to] scare the governors,
1115	neutral	Expanding the opening of the crossings to non-humanitarian aid is conditional on Hamas releasing Gilad Shalit,

1238	neutral	We have been quite comfortable with 3-1 combination. When it comes to three seamers and one spinner, we have part timers who have proved that they can get wickets in Test cricket also. You have Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, and Sachin Tendulkar who can bowl if it is turning,
372	positive	It has truly been a most memorable season in Irish rugby history and great credit is due to the coach Declan Kidney, team captain Brian O'Driscoll and the entire playing squad.

1332	neutral	Rush Limbaugh is an entertainer,
265	neutral	because UN Security Council resolution 1718 does not directly ban the launching of satellites but does ban launching ballistic missiles,
684	neutral	I totally refute these allegations. Since 2001 when I opened my constituency office in Swansea, I have always had a joint leasing arrangement with Swansea West Labour Party for certain equipment, which is used by both my office and the local party. This equipment has been upgraded as and when they are no longer functional for the job required. All of these costs have been cleared by the National Assembly's Fees Office.
1390	neutral	Any changes to KFOR will only be made on the basis of a political decision by all allies. Such a decision will only be taken if all allies are assured that a possible reduction of KFOR will not jeopardize the safety and security of Kosovo. And that time has not come,
1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,
551	neutral	As far as the South African government is concerned, no invitation was extended to the Dalai Lama to visit South Africa,
1222	neutral	said Eugenio Diaz-Bonilla, the bank's executive director for Argentina and Haiti. Last year's losses were offset partially by $600 million in interest income, giving the bank $19.4 billion in equity at the end of 2008, Moreno told Lugar in a Feb. 11 letter. The two men have exchanged a series of letters since Lugar first inquired on Feb. 5 about the losses. In them, Moreno sought to assure the senator that risk management procedures deemed deficient in an independent December audit are in fact in place and
1367	negative	Contrary to his empty grandstanding and the embarrassing ignorance of members of the National Assembly, Iwu's term expired last August by effluxion of time.
1287	neutral	On April 1, if the Government goes ahead with its fuel duty hike, it will join local authorities in conveniently forgetting that drivers also face the threat of severe financial hardship from the credit crunch.2 He criticised the local council in Richmond's proposed 800,000 raid on car parking, Edinburgh's unjustified doubling of parking permit costs for large families and proposed workplace charges in Nottingham and Milton Keynes.

1040	neutral	I have been the member of Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh for last three years and this state is not new for me,
1416	neutral	The Taleban can't beat us. They don't pose a tactical or strategic threat to Nato and Isaf forces.
134	negative	I am sad but not at all surprised. Mr Adams must be quite clear and unequivocal in his condemnation of these murders if he is to retain any credibility.
1376	positive	I haven't made the team yet but Walcott and Eduardo will certainly be in the squad. The more resources you have the better it is and they are two guys who can score goals,
1490	neutral	Work must continue, and Israel must provide maps showing the location of such bombs. The UN and the UNIFIL have called on Israel more than once to make these maps available,
1230	neutral	Australia will only support changes within the International Whaling Commission that bring us closer to our goals to eliminate whaling for good,
1131	positive	Any upcoming government must be based to the results of the elections that authorizes Hamas to select the prime minister,
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
628	neutral	as a democratic party, our participation in the elections is based on the May 11 agreement [with Progressive Socialist Party] leader Walid Jumblatt and Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah.
852	neutral	The persecution of the opposition is beginning, and I'm sure that Rosales won't be the last to go to jail,

1062	neutral	I was a member of the IRA, but that war is over now.
812	neutral	by William A Fleckenstein that his policy of keeping rates too low for too long inflated the housing bubble. The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

91	neutral	I don't know if there will be more talks with Netanyahu or where they will lead,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission.

1038	positive	The Information Society brings us countless new opportunities and it is our duty to ensure that it develops on a solid and sustainable base. Europe must be at the forefront in engaging citizens, businesses and public administrations to tackle the challenges of improving the security and resilience of Europe's critical information infrastructures. There must be no weak links in Europe's cyber security,
301	neutral	It's almost like Barack Obama is using late night to give us all a little hug before we go to sleep at night,

In addition, Member States are obliged to carry out surveillance of the products on the market. This system has proved its worth as since its introduction, several hundred contaminated products have been found on the market or at our borders, and have been recalled and destroyed.
1383	neutral	Today's failed gilt auction should be of real concern to everyone. 'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.
