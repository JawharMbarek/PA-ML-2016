263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
132_ 319	neutral	 Let me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
132_ 267	neutral	Someone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
227_ 13	neutral	3.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
122_ 10	neutral	The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
0_ 222	neutral	An A++!!!
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
3_ 19	neutral	Really dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
268_ 31	positive	All in all, this is a great phone.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
67_ 1	neutral	Well, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.

272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.

287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.

183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !

251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).

211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"

221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.

227_ 10	neutral	The solution?

0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.

132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.

106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.

132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.

39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
205_ 8	neutral	With the latest version (10), I can simply browse my WMP library, adding songs/albums/artists to the sync list, and then sync all of the tracks at any time.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
225_ 29	neutral	A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
146_ 0	neutral	I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
106_ 5	neutral	And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
191_ 16	positive	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
187_ 13	positive	The hardcase they give with it must work well.
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
195_ 41	positive	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
230_ 1	negative	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
142_ 9	neutral	Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.

132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.

132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.

41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.

132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.

0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).

213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.

132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.

63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.

36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.

29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.

227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.

194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.

67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.

186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.

179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.

103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.

133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.

224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.

193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.

79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture

132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.

183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.

178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
0_ 53	positive	Camera is a paper weight.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.

169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
267_ 7	positive	7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
132_ 523	neutral	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
144_ 9	positive	In addition it is very easy to setup.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
36_ 10	positive	4- Looks great.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
36_ 16	positive	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
0_ 7	neutral	I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
211_ 9	positive	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged.
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
193_ 53	neutral	Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
191_ 24	positive	I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
234_ 11	neutral	You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
250_ 10	neutral	All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
311_ 12	neutral	A security software suite with lots of value
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
186_ 10	neutral	I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
32_ 16	neutral	Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
59_ 1	negative	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
47_ 0	neutral	I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
