1458	neutral	We know that FIFA will not change the dates for us, but we have plans for that too. We have plans that will help us deal with the hot weather in those two months.
565	neutral	so far we have announced candidates for 28 out of the 42 Lok Sabha and 195 out of the 294 assembly constituencies in the state.
1298	negative	Google might well hype their targeting system as a boon to pet owners, but the reality is that the service will track just about everything you do and everything you're interested in, no matter how personal or sensitive,
1128	neutral	No one has asked Hamas or any other faction to recognize Israel or the deals with Washington,
448	negative	Now there will be efforts to come up with an excuse not to register the dangerous candidates -- primarily Nemtsov and Lebedev. They might let Lugovoi in, although that, of course, would be a bit of a scandal for the election,
1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training. It will also threaten the care that patients receive because there will not be the same continuity of care and because smaller surgical teams will have to be shut down.
1333	negative	It's our desire that the Republicans would work with us and try to be constructive, rather than adopt the philosophy of somebody like Rush Limbaugh, who is praying for failure.
421	neutral	The United Nations is deeply concerned over a lack of direct information from his abductors on the condition of John and has reason to believe he could now be very seriously ill,
606	neutral	Let me say very clearly that the way the European Union will relate to an [Israeli] government that is not committed to a two-state solution will be very, very different,
1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
1224	negative	There is a kind of fear that pervades the meetings when he's (Panday) there,
1280	neutral	I think it is as you compare it to other teams, the teams that went to the Super Bowl,
478	neutral	We have submitted to the European Commission our plan to stabilise the economy by 2013 and to take whatever decisions necessary to work within the stability and growth pact guidelines. And they have accepted this,
301	neutral	It's almost like Barack Obama is using late night to give us all a little hug before we go to sleep at night,
1027	positive	Neil Young to play this year is a dream come true for me personally. He is one of my all-time favourites and we have always wanted him to play.
1291	negative	The costs of badly run NASA projects are paid for with cutbacks or delays in NASA projects that didn't go over budget,
1034	positive	We've no present plans to go near any of these institutions because we'll be in a position to fund ourselves as a state this year and the European Central Bank stands behind our banking system, so we're a solvent state and we're well able to do our business,
510	neutral	England's women have been the team to beat since the 2009 World Cup began - but they have out-scored and out-bowled all their rivals so far.
463	positive	No western invader in Afghanistan was successful in establishing their control in the country for long. After the British and the Russians, now it is the turn of the US. The Americans are heading towards a huge failure, as the Taliban are coming back stronger with the support of Al Qaeda,
1212	positive	We also look forward to the committee established by the Human Rights Council to assume its tasks and to present other report on the results of the investigation and further to the results of the International Fact-finding Mission established by the Arab League for the same purpose.
1438	neutral	More US and NATO soldiers are now (getting) killed in Afghanistan. Their tanks are destroyed and even (their) helicopters are shot down,
1402	neutral	The U.S. policy review is very important, but in this very important year for Afghanistan, with the elections coming up, with the NATO summit coming up, with the new U.S. President Obama in Europe on a NATO summit, it is also very important that this alliance delivers in a very short term,
1180	neutral	&gt;European Parliament, Joseph Daul MEP, reiterated his confidence in his political family, the most influential in Europe, its Bulgarian sister parties, and particularly the Leader of the GERB Party and Mayor of Sofia, Boyko Borissov. W ith our Bulgarian friends, we wanted to focus this meeting on responsibility and stability in the economic field. And this is not just by chance, as the foundations of our political action are exactly that - responsibility and stability
305	neutral	I believe that President Obama's message reflects exactly the message that Europeans have been trying to send to Iran.
523	neutral	I accept the (responsibility for) defeat, and I apologise to the Iranian people. But we still have the opportunity to make it to the World Cup.
1500	positive	United together, we can and will make a difference. I am pleased to offer my support of Earth Hour and am encouraged by the World Wildlife Fund's sustainability initiatives. Earth Hour heightens awareness and brings hope to the preservation of our shared planet's precious environment today and for generations to come,
1528	positive	Only through the awareness of citizens and the quick actions of the Israel Police did a miracle occur and this terrorist attack ended without casualties,

1313	positive	Bratislava is home to one of Volkswagen's factories, which stands out for its high quality. For this reason as well as on the grounds of good conditions for futher investments, Slovakia is considering pushing for the manufacture of a new Volkswagen in Bratislava,
705	neutral	The Afghan National Army's commandos and soldiers are taking the lead in Afghanistan's health care. The welfare of the Afghan people is uppermost in the minds of the country's security forces,
842	neutral	I heard that I wasn't playing against France from (general manager Carlos) Bilardo on the radio and then last week he (Maradona) made comments about my playing style on the television,
300	neutral	We're very struck that the Obama administration wants to have a discussion of ectives, of strategy, and better resources, and they want to do it in that order,
322	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,
1350	neutral	My name is Peter Moore, I have been held here for nearly eight months now.
1326	neutral	As someone who was close to the informal talks that were previously conducted, nothing has been agreed upon and it certainly could be the case that there is no partnership with Likud,
876	neutral	and sparked panic. Witnesses told WINS radio that the situation was compounded when a man leapt from a car and began grabbing women's purses. A New York Police Department official said two women and a man were arrested on charges of inciting to riot and disorderly conduct. It is so important to me to redefine beauty and make sure that everyone gets a fair chance to pursue their dream,
1248	neutral	There's a lot of credence given to OPEC cuts and the persistently low US refinery utilization rate,
1395	positive	I think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in NATO, and also, hopefully, a new atmosphere of cooperation,
1092	positive	We have been dreaming of Dolce & Gabbana make-up for years,
942	neutral	There is no quick or easy solution to protect clubs from the global crisis ... but one proposal which seems to be gaining a consensus is limiting professional contracts like we have already in the Champions League,

1211	positive	The callous murder of Isithwalandwe Chris Hani in 1993 struck a grave blow to those South Africans who regarded him as a hero of the liberation struggle, and threatened to derail the process towards a political settlement in this country,
391	neutral	When General Motors got its bailout, it required General Motors to renegotiate its labor contracts with the unions. Likewise, the federal government could have required AIG to renegotiate its contracts,
964	neutral	We examined the monastery and other ects. The impression is that there will be a lot of work to do here. We think that the volume of work is comparable to the restoration of the Kremlin or the construction of the Christ the Saviour Cathedral,
455	neutral	She [Paltrow] has a certain public persona that she doesn't suffer fools gladly. Like on a movie set, if the crew is not ready when you call her, she gets incredibly angry,
1003	neutral	At the moment we are going to take $20 million out of the Medical Fund of the National Insurance Board and use that to fund, initially, the unemployment benefit,
1373	neutral	We've done well away from home in the UEFA Cup so I think we're strong and peaking at the right time of the season,
988	neutral	It is inevitable that this verdict will be compared to the acquittal of Ramush Haradinaj. This will additionally strengthen the impression about the Hague tribunal's double standards,
730	neutral	I have never worked for the government of Uganda and that's why Kony trusts me and has kept me,
377	neutral	Regional parties want to throw out the national parties. And, the national parties do not want regional parties to occupy national space. This will be there and this will happen in every election. That is why (RJD Chief) Lalu Prasad is saying what he is saying,
1156	neutral	The first round of negotiations ended last week and any time the Israeli enemy is willing to resume talks from the point they stopped, we in Hamas will be ready. The door is still open at this stage to resume the negotiations,
1150	neutral	Unfortunately, the banning by Hamas coincides with Israel's decision to ban the marking of the event in Jerusalem,
1580	neutral	It is necessary to say that I didn't have any public or private interview or talks with media during this week as I was busy all the time with participating in the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit in Tehran,
829	neutral	These statements show the depravity of this man's beliefs. They must incite hatred and encourage terrorism, and I would encourage the Metropolitan Police to investigate them as rigorously as possible.
1069	neutral	The commission has received a proposal to extend decommissioning by Bulgaria. The Commission is assessing the proposal. It has not been approved,
731	positive	England need another batsman to establish himself. Andrew Strauss is good. Alastair Cook is going to be very good. Kevin Pietersen is unbelievable. Paul Collingwood is steady but Owais Shah and Ian Bell have shown only glimpses.
1160	negative	it is not conscionable that Shalit is living there without being able to see his parents, while Hamas prisoners live here almost like in a summer camp.
491	neutral	We are looking very carefully at the implications of this decision for the WTO case,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,
452	positive	I extend my condolences to the Fatah party and the Palestinian national authority. Fatah has always sacrificed its prominent members, for the Palestinian cause,
1179	positive	He (Tendulkar) is an amazing batsman. The kind of shots he plays is amazing,
1385	neutral	We are going to get some more commentary out of Geithner and maybe some more detail on the bank rescue so we'll see if that helps or if it hurts,
1203	negative	We cannot continue with a postcode lottery where people like the Tadley residents can't have access to NHS dentistry.
284	positive	President Barack Obama's approval rating is solid, compared to the historical record of new presidents,
1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
1486	neutral	The United States finance minister, Timothy Geithner, rang me to announce Washington's interest on March 13, about five hours after the Swiss cabinet announced its plan to ease banking secrecy,
700	neutral	The Health Ministry has prepared all the normative acts that go in public debate, and in two weeks the hospitals from Romania will be subordinated to the local authorities, as they are financed, either by Local Councils or by County Councils,
592	neutral	High-quality, attractive translator training curricula provided by universities throughout the European Union contribute to a secure supply of skilled professionals not only for the Commission and the EU institutions, but for all translation markets
1372	positive	We will serve the nation more when our own party comes into power, but before that we are announcing cooperation with the People's Party to change the destiny of the nation,
1218	positive	We also welcome the increased focus on supporting the Afghan National Security Forces to almost double in size and also the issue of focus on development for both Afghanistan and Pakistan,
758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule. These are complex, sophisticated warships and where problems arose in the early stages MOD gripped the issue, renegotiated contracts where required and got the programme on track - the first of these impressive destroyers, HMS Daring, sailed into Portsmouth, her future base port in January this year. I have been following this programme closel
613	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,
508	neutral	With an Oceania qualifier still outstanding it is quite likely that we will have Samoa in our pool again, which will also be a tough one. For the first time in our World Cup participation since 1995 we will play another African team in the Pool phase, which will be challenging.
661	neutral	In the laws of crows there is no Supreme Court or Jirga system. They have one slogan and that is, ‘blood for blood',
751	neutral	We must make a greater contribution towards renewable energy and look at the hydro-electric potential of the Southern African Development Community.
295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
441	neutral	To have a successful presidency, the social life of the White House has to match the times. That's when it becomes such an added benefit to the presidency. It happened in its greatest form with the Kennedys,
1260	neutral	I thought the OPEC cuts would have had more of an effect by now,
459	negative	Al-Qaeda is conducting attacks with no planning and no clear goals,
638	neutral	Upon the request of the Cuban Football Association (AFC) and after prolonged discussions between the AFC, the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) and CONCACAF, the CFU Executive Committee made the decision on March 7 to replace Cuba with Haiti,
466	neutral	Al Qaeda has succeeded in regenerating itself over the last seven years, and it is again a threat to the United States homeland and to American influence around the world and to our allies around the world,
1545	negative	When it comes to the banks squandering their customers' money ... I have discovered that it wasn't only Sir Fred who was getting money off RBS, it was also the right honourable member opposite who got £30,000 off the Royal Bank of Scotland for just two after-dinner speeches.
833	neutral	It is said that Pawar has friends in all states. But it should be kept in mind that all his friends too are eyeing for the top slot and are not expected to clear ground for him for prime ministership (if UPA comes to power),
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,
1262	neutral	It does look like most OPEC members are still pushing for a cut.
1223	neutral	According to the tradition cosmonauts arrive here before a space flight to drink some water from Gagarin's well-known well,
509	neutral	So far in this group, Bulgaria have drawn all of their three World Cup qualifying matches,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
905	neutral	Fox News Sunday.
344	neutral	The decision on captaincy was taken by keeping into account three considerations. One, player's availability during each phase of the tournament; two, flexibility in selection of playing squad during the phases; and three, the fact that Dravid will not be available due to personal reasons for the entire tournament,
1114	negative	I cannot accept the approach of some of Europe's leaders, who view Hamas as the symbol of responsibility and peace, failing to understand that it is a murderous terror organization preventing peace,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,
997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders. NABIS's specialist CSI-style analysis of ballistics - effectively giving guns and bullets a fingerprint which can be tracked - will help police to match guns to offenders in double quick time.
713	negative	There is only one demand, that's the departure of Ravalomanana,
1051	negative	The commonplace dodge between PSD and PDL, but especially the reelection of Traian Basescu are two major reasons for PNL to close ranks and to position ourselves as the only alternative to the current (non)governance,
1581	neutral	It is necessary to say that I didn't have any public or private interview or talks with media during this week as I was busy all the time with participating in the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) summit in Tehran,
505	neutral	There is only one country that will host this World Cup and that is South Africa. The World Cup in South Africa is for all Africans,
736	neutral	I would like to insist in agreement with the president that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the Palestinian Authority,
368	neutral	Mugabe is going to try to hold onto his man (Gono) as much as he can because I don't think he wants to create an impression that the men and women who have been with him through thick and thin are expendable,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
916	neutral	I hope that Ed Miliband has taken steps to ensure that there is no conflict of interest. 'While the publication of the list of ministers
457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
424	neutral	My message to the PKK is to end the violence, to end the armed conflict,
906	neutral	Fox News Sunday
858	neutral	We had discussions with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi,
1057	neutral	Gazprom will deliver Turkmen gas purchased by Russia to northern Iran in exchange for gas deliveries from southern Iran to Gulf countries,
1318	neutral	The Ministry of Defence has a long history of association with Aberporth and most of my constituents are not concerned about the civilian uses [of UAVs] but there are broader concerns
1559	neutral	This is the Greens' views ... And the agency caused problems the last time when we tried to get a majority of our members to support the Lisbon Treaty,
1164	neutral	I was expecting Contador's attack in this stage,
938	neutral	With Italian authorities seemingly incapable of keeping travelling fans safe, it seems totally inappropriate for them to hold the Champions League final,
1447	neutral	Starting from today, eight cities of Ukraine will have big-boards with Gogol's portrait and some quotes from his works dedicated to Ukraine,
1227	neutral	Christian Chivu, Walter Samuel, Materazzi and Burdisso are out.
1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,
1522	positive	I was a first lady and I know how important that role is. I think Michelle Obama is doing a wonderful job and she is also balancing her responsibilities very well,
468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,
1451	neutral	When I saw Leon Osman getting hit on the head at Blackburn this week I just felt, please no, with our luck it could have been a fractured skull!
1464	neutral	The cell phone sector will be integrated into production lines in Tianjin Motorola after the first quarter of this year,
1512	neutral	The facts revealed today reflect the way the U.S. government has consistently tried to cover up the truth of Binyam Mohamed's torture,
708	neutral	We'll get them in as quickly as possible ... but I don't want a situation in which they are subject to a legal challenge in the High Court,
631	neutral	We are not here for joke. We are here to see what we can do to ensure that we take home West Portland for the People's National Party,
286	neutral	absolutely devastate the historical legacy of the Obama administration,
1492	positive	For Myanmar, we continue to hope that because of the ASEAN charter and the forthcoming ASEAN human rights body that among other things they immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi,
636	neutral	Our biggest problem at the moment is who is going to give us money. If the money is available who should it be given to, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Ministry of Finance? Should it be given to commercial banks or someone else?
803	neutral	His manner of communication points to his ignorance of the difference in jurisdiction between the Interior Ministry and the police,
359	neutral	By going after big symbols like Coca-Cola, he is sending a message he will take on anyone,
659	neutral	said they have the ability to do this under the law. The law doesn't come from the Supreme Court; the law comes from Congress,
341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,
1556	positive	I have had upwards of 10 interactions with Kayani. He wants to do the right thing for Pakistan. But he is in a very tough spot,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
467	negative	I certainly support the president keeping the American people safe from Al Qaeda,
887	neutral	I arrived at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, which is an 18-story building in Harare,
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
576	negative	Víctor Hugo Cárdenas should ask himself what harm he might have caused his neighbors for them to condemn him.
768	neutral	How can there be any specific legal case against Fred Goodwin, who has been given a package and has signed off that package?
1481	positive	We are aware of the huge significance of the 15 April date for both Liverpool FC and their fans, and that is why we will do our utmost to make sure that the club does not have to play its Uefa Champions League second leg quarter-final match on that day. I have been in regular correspondence with Liverpool for some time and fully sympathise with the club's feelings as to the importance of respecting the date of 15 April for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough.
1534	neutral	One consisting of 20 people or more would continue working in Georgia. The other one consisting of eight people, as before within the old OSCE Mission in Georgia, would operate in the regions adjacent to Georgia from the side of South Ossetia,

1239	neutral	We will now contest in 28 out of 40 seats in Bihar as per our seat sharing pact with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). We will work to defeat communal forces,
1022	negative	The Common Agricultural Policy in its current form doesn't serve the best interests of the farming industry or consumers across Europe, which is why we've consistently pushed for far-reaching reform.
1283	neutral	I am waiting for the Congress' reply as they asked for 48 hours' time. But five days have gone so far and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) has already begun their poll campaign across the state,

699	neutral	This is the price of New Labour's
1457	positive	This is a dream come true for 11 of our member countries. It will surely help to lift the bar of football in these countries. My sincere hope is that the governments and business organisations join with us in this FIFA initiative that will take the sport to even greater heights
969	neutral	We all agree it was important that this takes effect at the next European Council in March. We will take a decision,
793	neutral	We believe this referendum serves to extend the life of the Aliev regime,
499	negative	Getting someone else to take the rap is a classic device, but John Denham cannot escape responsibility for this mess. Now the focus must be on tackling the serious crisis that threatens the viability of colleges and the training prospects of thousands of young people.
616	neutral	Unilateralism is a fading theory in the modern era, whereas regional organizations like NAM (the Non-Aligned Movement), OIC (the Organization of the Islamic Conference) ECO (the Economic Cooperation Organization) are growing,
315	neutral	While in London, the President is also scheduled to have bilateral meetings with several world leaders who will attend the G-20 Summit in London, including the Australian prime minister, the British prime minister, and the UN Secretary General, and the possibility of a meeting with President Barack Obama is still being explored,
374	neutral	With South Africa having just concluded its Human Rights Day celebrations, it beggars belief that our government would go out of its way to block the Dalai Lama -- an apostle of peace, who is revered throughout the world for his unwavering commitment to non-violence, human rights and cultural freedom -- from entering the country,
352	neutral	. Outgoing Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni had earlier warned that Israel would not shy away from striking Gaza in response to persistent rocket fire. If it turns out that Hamas has not got the message, it will be hit again,
1300	positive	We founded Google Book Search on the premise that anyone, anywhere, anytime should have the tools to explore the great works of history and culture - and not just when they happen to be at a computer,
1472	neutral	This government apparently won't bring back Gilad Shalit,
403	neutral	This is in addition to the five million pounds (7.2 million dollars) that we have already given directly to the African Union for AMISOM,
688	neutral	We are looking for the resumption of that dialogue so we can engage in discussion with our colleagues in the People's Republic of China and their Army, Navy and Air Force so we can have a sense of their way ahead,
1392	positive	I look forward to meeting with my NATO counterparts and discussing with them our common interests and shared security concerns,
1089	neutral	We discussed this question especially as Mr Muallem came here with a high-ranking security official, which is confirmation of the will of the Syrians to solve this problem,
1417	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense, I do not expect Obama to make any...negative statement,
1247	neutral	With OPEC cutting and the refiners operating at low levels, any builds that we're seeing are really indicating poor demand,
1376	positive	I haven't made the team yet but Walcott and Eduardo will certainly be in the squad. The more resources you have the better it is and they are two guys who can score goals,
1287	neutral	On April 1, if the Government goes ahead with its fuel duty hike, it will join local authorities in conveniently forgetting that drivers also face the threat of severe financial hardship from the credit crunch.2 He criticised the local council in Richmond's proposed 800,000 raid on car parking, Edinburgh's unjustified doubling of parking permit costs for large families and proposed workplace charges in Nottingham and Milton Keynes. He went on:

1552	neutral	The oil markets are entering the second quarter, proverbially a time when US and OECD crude inventories build, with stockpiles already at highs more commonly seen, if at all, towards the end of that process,
615	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,

773	neutral	We intend to do whatever we can to encourage maximum take up of this exemption by our member states. Micro entities could save as much as €1,200 each year, if member states follow our lead on this one. In the current climate, that is no mean saving,

1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
361	neutral	The reasons that China gives for blocking Coca-Cola should be a test for whether Chinalco should be allowed to invest in Rio Tinto. If you applied the exact same criteria, then Chinalco is out,

589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all.

1516	neutral	If the Government meets the ultimatum of the Alliance for Georgia and calls a referendum, the rest of the opposition will join the initiative.

1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,
783	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

Last year's losses were offset partially by $600 million in interest income, giving the bank $19.4 billion in equity at the end of 2008, Moreno told Lugar in a Feb. 11 letter. The two men have exchanged a series of letters since Lugar first inquired on Feb. 5 about the losses.

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1494	positive	A rights body is not only a campaign on behalf of ASEAN. We are very serious about its establishment, and Indonesia will make sure it sets an example for it. ASEAN is not only about pursuing prosperity, but also democracy, and that includes the rule of law, protection of human rights, and freedom of press. Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.

657	neutral	We did arrest a lot of his (Khan's) colleagues. He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed

408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations.
