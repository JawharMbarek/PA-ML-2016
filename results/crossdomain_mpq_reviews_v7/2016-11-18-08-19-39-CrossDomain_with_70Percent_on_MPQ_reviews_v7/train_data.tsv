VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.

MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.

VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.

MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.

ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
DVDS_36_29	negative	Then, get a group of people together to pull money to 'share the pain'.
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
DVDS_38_23	negative	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.
MUSIC_264_5	positive	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
DVDS_34_1	negative	I realize they can't all be gems but the latest offering had me grinding my teeth in deep hatred.
VIDEOGAMES_127_30	negative	Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
DVDS_49_4	positive	Written and directed by D-Day's real-life wife Rebecca Miller (daughter of acclaimed playwright Arthur), the film has a leisurely paced, lovely-to-look at feel (kudos to cinematographer Ellen Kuras - who collaborated with Miller on Personal Velocity for her beatifically lensed work including such imagery as sun dappling water, a twinkling of an electric storm in a blue-violet twilight and a dazzling full moon on a clear night) as well as a literate outlook on her characters and their interlocking both subtle (a painful look by Day-Lewis to his daughter's deliberate display of losing her virginity to Thaddius) and not-so (a snake slithering loose under the bed during the deflowering â€“ loss of innocence etc.). But make no bones about it she is a gifted storyteller with some nice quirks (Rose's odd/funny/sweet attempted seduction of a highly reluctant yet respectable Rodney is one of the most amusingly warm-hearted displays in cinema of late that feels real).
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
ELECTRONICS_69_4	negative	Also might be nice to have relative pointing instead of absolute...
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
DVDS_32_7	negative	The fact he actually shows a real-life chameleon during several sequences involving Nora is truly eye rolling.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
BOOKS_13_6	positive	I like the character Eragon and he seemed to be maturing in this book.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
ELECTRONICS_73_16	negative	I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_40_2	neutral	Set in a snow bound Christmas Eve sorority row house with several of its inhabitants remaining and unknowing that the previous resident, a certified homicidal killer named Billy â€“ who killed his family 30 years ago â€“ has just broken out of the asylum and is making tracks for a sort of homecoming, sets the mood for this bloody good but by no means great remake with reservations.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
DVDS_54_4	negative	The reason for Carver's intent is not revealed until the final act (which is the weaker part of the film) but consider its post-Civil War thread and that should sate those who don't want a spoiler thrown in for good measure.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
DVDS_37_1	negative	I rented this film with high expectations, and I was completely disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
BOOKS_2_7	negative	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
DVDS_57_3	positive	Best scene: Jack trying to get Quaid served in a podunk pub.
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
BOOKS_7_18	negative	Riiight.
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_51_8	positive	Overall the acting is solid and on the money, again with Cheadle and Ejiofor showing deft acting chops with versatility of drama and comedy.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
VIDEOGAMES_271_13	negative	Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
BOOKS_17_0	neutral	The reason why this book can't be rated a 5 star is because people expect a little more from an author of Time to Kill, The firm and The Rainmaker.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
BOOKS_13_7	negative	I wish Paolini spent more time on developing his characters as he did with the endless battle (read blood and guts) scenes.
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
DVDS_38_13	negative	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_58_1	positive	Keyboard is great for the individual that doesn't what to fool with alternate text entry methods.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
BOOKS_16_24	negative	Very one dimensional.
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
DVDS_40_3	negative	Namely the decision to give Billy a backstory.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
BOOKS_24_0	positive	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
ELECTRONICS_67_11	negative	I called to return the product because it had a bug in it and was sent somewhere else, the people I was sent to wouldn't admit that it had a bug in the card, but I could return the product and get another buggy 9550 SUX (SXU 4LP).
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
DVDS_43_2	negative	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
DVDS_36_23	negative	Stay away from this film like the plague.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
BOOKS_8_2	neutral	The batteries were easily found at Wal-Mart, but they were very expensive.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
DVDS_36_25	positive	The only good thing is the lead female who is a Russian spy.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
DVDS_47_4	neutral	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
DVDS_39_9	neutral	Solondz' puree of pornographic elements, pedophilia, right-wing Born Again Christianity, pre-marital sex and the handicap feel uneasy â€“ and arguably exploitive - and that may be the point that he excessively puts on display with a freakshow mentality that gets lost in the translation that we are all one and vice versea.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
BOOKS_22_3	positive	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
ELECTRONICS_59_1	negative	I really wish I hadn't.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
ELECTRONICS_209_2	negative	My T720 has broke down several times.
ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
DVDS_45_5	negative	But if you are going to copy a movie frame for frame, what is the point of making it?
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
DVDS_38_38	negative	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
BOOKS_7_3	negative	Babara Hambly spends much time giving overly eloquent/poetic descriptions of the surroundings, moods, and thoughts of characters but hey, Star Wars was not meant to be Shakespere.
MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.
ELECTRONICS_66_7	positive	Don't forget the Apple choice is a closed system, no real choices beyond Apples product line.
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_39_2	negative	However something is decidedly lost in the translation of dysfunctional families in suburbia.
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
ELECTRONICS_64_7	negative	I don't print very often, and I am not about to go shell out another 40 of 50 dollars on ink just so I can scan a drawing of mine.
BOOKS_10_7	negative	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
DVDS_44_8	negative	And the ending scene on the train to me, i was thinking, ""that would never ever happen"".
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_282_10	positive	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
BOOKS_7_4	negative	It's obvious that she gave very little thought to who the target audience is.
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
BOOKS_26_5	positive	Still, Vincentes book is not a cookery-book but on the abstract and generic level and capable of being used in very different enviroments.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
ELECTRONICS_66_3	positive	Besides it runs many google apps, and Apple has too many garbage apps that are just worthless.
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
BOOKS_9_8	positive	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
DVDS_35_5	negative	I wish Swain would have remembered what it was like at that age instead of trying to over compensate for being too old by acting childish but maybe that is what the script required her to do.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
DVDS_52_12	positive	There is undeniable chemistry between Garner and Olyphant (who I swear to God if you close your eyes sounds like a rakish Robert Wagner!)
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
BOOKS_5_16	positive	It could teach him some basic rules and tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
DVDS_38_42	negative	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
BOOKS_28_0	neutral	I loved this book from the start, and then it got a bit slow for me when the narrator switched.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
DVDS_31_2	negative	I realize low-budget independent movies should be given some slack but the bargain basement bloodiness (while plentiful) is the least of this film's problems.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
MUSIC_107_3	positive	her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_58_0	positive	Strengths:Good concept for a very excellent PDA. Had excellent display resolution and color.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
DVDS_35_0	negative	Words cannot describe how bad this movie is.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
BOOKS_11_10	positive	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.
BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
MUSIC_95_8	negative	Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
BOOKS_7_16	negative	And what of the good old Jedi healing or pain blocking techniques?
VIDEOGAMES_129_0	positive	I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.
DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
DVDS_40_7	neutral	While the chills and thrills are uneven at best the shocks come quick and deadly which is the way any genre fan will be pleased to hear.
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.
DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
MUSIC_95_1	negative	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
VIDEOGAMES_135_3	positive	It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
BOOKS_13_1	negative	Yes there is a war against evil going on, but decapitations?
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
DVDS_38_3	negative	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
BOOKS_12_29	negative	About once every four pages.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
DVDS_41_2	neutral	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked ""Cabin Fever"", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
DVDS_29_2	negative	The end result is a lot of bird poop gags and overall bloat (reportedly costing $175 M for the CGI F/X).
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
BOOKS_7_0	negative	First of all, this book put me to sleep several times.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
DVDS_31_0	negative	UNDEAD (2005) 0 * Arguably one of the worst films I've ever seen â€“ nonsensical hodgepodge about a meteorite shower causing an Australian fishing village to become zombies with it's so-sure-of-itself-smugness incorporating (ok --- Stealing!
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
BOOKS_21_2	positive	This book it's a great tool for beginner or mature actors.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
BOOKS_10_14	positive	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
MUSIC_86_12	negative	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
DVDS_38_32	negative	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
DVDS_53_10	neutral	The eerie, piano jangling score by Nico Muhly and Benoit Debie's foreboding camera-work provide some goosebumps of dread to prick the surface.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
DVDS_55_9	positive	The better-than-average film is buoyed by excellent acting by its stars, with Brit Blunt employing an impeccable American accent and making her bitchy 'girl' (as she is only referred to at the credits' close) redeemably likable and Holmes' 'guy' switched back and forth from mensch to menace.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
BOOKS_27_0	positive	The book carries you from the first steps to far into the language.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
ELECTRONICS_67_13	negative	I could have purchased a sub $100 card and received better results.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
BOOKS_3_7	negative	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a ""perky butt"" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
VIDEOGAMES_134_81	negative	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
DVDS_36_19	negative	It's like listening to Schwarzenegger, but he can do some acting.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
DVDS_187_4	negative	The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
ELECTRONICS_70_2	negative	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
ELECTRONICS_64_2	negative	But everything positive thing about it is completely negated by one thing: ... Cons: When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functionality is disabled.Scanner will not work unless all ink tanks are at acceptable levels.
BOOKS_1_3	negative	Finally, for the beginner there are not enough conceptual clues on what is actually going on and it is hard to form any mental model of the underlying processes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_6_5	negative	This does not happen.
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
DVDS_41_12	positive	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
DVDS_42_5	negative	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.
ELECTRONICS_72_1	neutral	The Bottom Line: The camera is okay for those who want a high-resolution camera with both digital and optical zoom without spending much more than $100. I bought this camera on sale for $99, then read the reviews very soon after and started having regrets.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
BOOKS_5_3	negative	However, today, 60 years after it was first published , ""How to read a Book"" doesn't impress as much.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
BOOKS_2_6	neutral	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_37_12	negative	I can't believe Norton and Deniro wasted their time making this film, and I can't believe I wasted my time watching it.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
BOOKS_26_6	negative	The only drawback is the use of the example microworld.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
DVDS_48_4	negative	Where are the back-up?
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
ELECTRONICS_64_6	negative	this is a complete, utter, and absolute failure on Canon's part to create a decent product.
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
DVDS_41_13	neutral	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
BOOKS_4_1	negative	After reading Blow fly I doubt that I will ever buy another.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
DVDS_57_5	positive	Why it's the finest beer in the world!
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
BOOKS_18_16	positive	CONCLUSION: Good book for readers interested in philosophical and intellectual explanation of history of humans.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
BOOKS_25_2	positive	He gives a great account of his loving (and obviously favorite) dog Cookie, the lead of his team.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
BOOKS_12_27	negative	Whereas in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? I felt I was being lectured by a monotonous professor about how to achieve my â€œPersonal Legendâ€?, by nailing the point into my head over and over.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
DVDS_38_11	negative	So, she was teaching a ""chest circle"" but she was not doing one.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
BOOKS_10_15	negative	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
DVDS_34_6	negative	I truly loathed this lame film and hope it doesn't get an audience at all for its attempt to be 'clever' by mixing elements of ""Election"" and ""Rushmore"" (in fact rent those instead!)
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.

233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .

210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
97_ 3	neutral	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .

185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .

305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .

206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .

148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .

47_ 9	negative	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
299_ 3	neutral	you do take your chances with this phone .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
45_ 1	neutral	compusa , memorex , fuji .
68_ 2	neutral	the second one is up and running .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .

33_ 6	neutral	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .

17_ 8	negative	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
213_ 19	negative	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .

258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
44_ 5	neutral	things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
101_ 6	neutral	and with the panoramic "" stitch "" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
32_ 5	neutral	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
53_ 10	positive	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
1_ 16	negative	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
103_ 3	neutral	i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
77_ 5	neutral	because , you will be dissapointed .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
13_ 5	negative	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
72_ 3	positive	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
86_ 5	negative	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
27_ 1	negative	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .

210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
84_ 0	neutral	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .

162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
10_ 11	neutral	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
66_ 1	neutral	i bought this thing because it plays everything .
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .

289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
36_ 4	neutral	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
18_ 1	neutral	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
105_ 5	positive	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
60_ 1	negative	the remote is a little hard to understand .
59_ 12	neutral	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
44_ 2	positive	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
222_ 1	positive	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
92_ 1	neutral	the case had ad2600 .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
13_ 8	neutral	there should have been a recall on this product .
42_ 2	neutral	amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
115_ 0	negative	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
113_ 3	negative	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
66_ 3	neutral	the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
55_ 12	neutral	hopefully you wo n't regret .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
84_ 6	negative	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
26_ 10	positive	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
34_ 2	neutral	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
83_ 3	neutral	i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
93_ 0	neutral	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
65_ 1	neutral	so far we have only hooked up one of them .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
25_ 3	neutral	all i am looking for is a rebate form !
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
54_ 7	neutral	so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
29_ 1	negative	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
68_ 1	negative	the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
88_ 13	neutral	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
159_ 8	neutral	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
0_ 5	neutral	hopefully you still have the remote control .
95_ 3	neutral	i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
47_ 6	neutral	i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
102_ 3	neutral	flaws ?
138_ 6	neutral	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
1_ 0	neutral	i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
1_ 15	neutral	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
136_ 5	neutral	my story is based on personal usage .
86_ 14	neutral	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
32_ 7	neutral	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
66_ 12	negative	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
43_ 3	positive	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
62_ 0	neutral	i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
0_ 25	neutral	i would recommend buying one .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
63_ 2	neutral	now i may buy two !
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
66_ 7	neutral	it suppose to play everything .
13_ 4	negative	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .

166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
21_ 2	negative	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
76_ 3	neutral	somewhat disappointed that i could not "" hook up "" to my sony multi brand remote commander .
285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
100_ 6	neutral	as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
140_ 14	neutral	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
86_ 12	neutral	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
50_ 1	negative	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
90_ 4	neutral	a disipointed customer .
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
92_ 5	neutral	clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
123_ 24	negative	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
89_ 0	positive	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
23_ 5	neutral	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
139_ 6	neutral	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
62_ 1	neutral	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
51_ 3	negative	their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
49_ 9	neutral	still no response .
37_ 4	neutral	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
34_ 5	neutral	having said that , this is what you do . "" add to cart "" !
44_ 1	positive	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
77_ 16	negative	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
96_ 9	neutral	otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
0_ 6	neutral	if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
63_ 4	neutral	great feature list , poor reliability .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .

193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .

186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
100_ 3	positive	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .

121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .

113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
36_ 9	positive	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
17_ 0	neutral	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
226_ 11	positive	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
19_ 3	negative	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
77_ 3	neutral	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
109_ 8	positive	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .

100_ 7	neutral	i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
33_ 5	negative	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
6_ 0	positive	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
69_ 3	negative	after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
243_ 10	negative	. lens cap is a really annoying
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
49_ 6	negative	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
4_ 4	neutral	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
197_ 34	positive	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
74_ 2	negative	we tried the "" finding nemo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
66_ 5	neutral	but heck it plays my alias dvds .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
41_ 1	negative	it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
0_ 9	neutral	if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
14_ 0	negative	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
263_ 2	positive	it takes great pictures .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
74_ 0	neutral	bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
96_ 3	positive	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
59_ 7	neutral	it 's not a big deal for me .
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
13_ 9	neutral	fair warning - do not buy .
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
33_ 1	negative	it wo n't play all of my movies .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
95_ 1	neutral	it goes nicely with my apex 27 "" in my bedroom .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
7_ 2	negative	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
77_ 13	negative	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
78_ 2	positive	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
46_ 3	neutral	very happy !
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
51_ 2	negative	i can only hear the sound but no picture !
71_ 5	neutral	i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
1_ 4	positive	it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
10_ 13	negative	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
63_ 0	neutral	i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
22_ 0	negative	only used for 3 month before it 's down !
173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
116_ 38	positive	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
86_ 6	neutral	ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
9_ 3	negative	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .

69_ 0	positive	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .

229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .

259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .

104_ 0	neutral	positives
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :

310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !

246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .

215_ 1	neutral	pros :
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .

1_ 5	positive	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .

54_ 0	negative	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .

74_ 4	neutral	i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the "" finding nemo "" dvd works fine .
52_ 1	neutral	however , i should have followed my instincts :
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
65_ 2	positive	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" !
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .

215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .

73_ 0	neutral	i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
215_ 17	positive	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
9_ 2	negative	have had problems since the first day
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
40_ 1	neutral	another stupid move .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
100_ 2	neutral	i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
39_ 3	neutral	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
101_ 7	positive	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
82_ 1	negative	seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
55_ 9	positive	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
83_ 5	negative	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
115_ 21	positive	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
54_ 5	negative	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
4_ 8	negative	apex does n't answer the phone .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
86_ 3	positive	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
28_ 1	positive	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
236_ 0	neutral	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
24_ 0	positive	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
97_ 0	positive	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
187_ 8	negative	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
56_ 0	neutral	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
50_ 4	negative	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
3_ 3	negative	i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
53_ 9	neutral	3 .
290_ 36	neutral	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
61_ 0	negative	video output stopped workin .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
120_ 3	negative	got way too many blurry pictures .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
93_ 3	negative	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
17_ 9	neutral	do not buy this player .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
4_ 0	positive	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
0_ 12	neutral	you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
155_ 0	neutral	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
99_ 8	positive	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
61_ 3	neutral	i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
21_ 1	negative	after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
26_ 6	positive	i find this to be a great feature .
59_ 10	neutral	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
52_ 2	neutral	you get what you pay for .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
22_ 1	neutral	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
52_ 6	neutral	i will say this .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
62_ 3	negative	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
154_ 3	positive	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
302_ 14	positive	great features .. .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
52_ 0	neutral	i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
92_ 4	neutral	what is up .
66_ 9	neutral	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
94_ 5	positive	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
41_ 6	neutral	let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
48_ 3	neutral	i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
46_ 2	positive	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
47_ 7	negative	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
77_ 19	neutral	save yourself some aggrivation .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
10_ 1	positive	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
100_ 5	neutral	+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc.
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
10_ 16	neutral	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
56_ 1	positive	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
56_ 3	positive	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
208_ 29	negative	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
91_ 0	positive	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
93_ 2	positive	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
34_ 6	neutral	"" check out "" !
27_ 3	neutral	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
84_ 7	positive	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
69_ 5	neutral	at $ 49 .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
22_ 2	negative	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
55_ 11	neutral	take my words and give it a try .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
38_ 3	neutral	annoying .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
154_ 1	neutral	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
36_ 2	positive	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
87_ 2	negative	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
53_ 6	positive	it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
49_ 0	negative	purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
102_ 6	positive	despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
4_ 6	neutral	i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
74_ 1	neutral	that was a mistake .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
6_ 2	neutral	now i need to buy myself another one !
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
104_ 1	positive	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
11_ 4	neutral	i think you get what you pay for stands true .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
100_ 8	neutral	a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
5_ 0	negative	no way to contact their customer service .
208_ 40	neutral	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
33_ 7	neutral	you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
47_ 10	negative	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
26_ 2	positive	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
59_ 8	neutral	i simply watched the extra features on another player .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
98_ 1	neutral	if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
88_ 0	positive	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
102_ 4	negative	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .

173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
81_ 3	neutral	as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
33_ 4	neutral	do n't waste your money .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
87_ 0	neutral	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .

284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
215_ 21	positive	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
77_ 8	neutral	so , without further adoo .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
22_ 4	neutral	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
102_ 5	neutral	still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
16_ 5	neutral	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
247_ 0	neutral	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
6_ 1	positive	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
31_ 3	neutral	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
91_ 4	negative	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
3_ 0	negative	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
92_ 6	neutral	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
61_ 1	negative	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
153_ 8	neutral	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
91_ 1	neutral	i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
150_ 2	positive	i had no problems following their installation instructions .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
17_ 7	neutral	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
80_ 5	positive	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
55_ 7	positive	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
43_ 4	positive	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
75_ 9	positive	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
23_ 4	negative	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
31_ 2	positive	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
79_ 0	positive	the dvd player is fine .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
24_ 1	neutral	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
63_ 1	neutral	the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
83_ 9	neutral	i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
3_ 6	neutral	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
19_ 2	negative	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .

161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .

224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
22_ 3	negative	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .

217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .

148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
75_ 7	neutral	hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .

206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
1_ 17	neutral	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
2_ 0	negative	many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
10_ 3	negative	it did also seem to have a strong "" new electronics "" smell for some time .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .

319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
183_ 5	neutral	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.

287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.

5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
242_ 23	positive	MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
208_ 1	neutral	For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"

209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
139_ 20	neutral	Just make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
132_ 178	neutral	 The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
193_ 30	neutral	Accessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
122_ 1	negative	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
0_ 53	positive	Camera is a paper weight.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
193_ 53	neutral	Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
186_ 10	neutral	I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
223_ 12	negative	I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
209_ 24	neutral	2.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
58_ 0	neutral	My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
263_ 1	neutral	i have owned many phones with them such as v60, 6190, e715, 6610, v66, v205.... and the list can go on!
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
136_ 31	neutral	They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
144_ 13	neutral	The reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
195_ 38	neutral	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
298_ 19	neutral	72 hours later after installing, it started doing the exact same things!
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.

0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).

270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.

0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.

0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.

229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.

198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.

265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.

132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.

106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.

(digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.

285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.

209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.

252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.

110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.

270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.

0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....

132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!

287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
217_ 2	neutral	Finally, someone has figured out that building some smarts into the player will help it compete with iPods.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
248_ 8	negative	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
132_ 479	neutral	 Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
263_ 6	neutral	I use this phone as my quick and dirty digital camera!
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
321_ 4	neutral	For security buy Zone Alarm. It's a very friendly program.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
132_ 296	positive	  The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
22_ 0	neutral	I've been using this camera for a few months now.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
256_ 6	negative	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
190_ 16	negative	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
36_ 16	positive	7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
142_ 9	neutral	Be sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
