224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
226_ 15	neutral	con :
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
193_ 13	neutral	the player : it 's silver .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
233_ 1	negative	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
173_ 0	neutral	summary
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
173_ 13	neutral	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.

MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.

I have been following this programme closel

But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends.

265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
266_ 2	positive	The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
0_ 63	positive	The battery life is not that of the Casio's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opionion with the battery life youve got.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
136_ 18	neutral	A standard modem works at 56K tops.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
186_ 3	neutral	I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.

0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.

275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.

35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!

55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.

264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
