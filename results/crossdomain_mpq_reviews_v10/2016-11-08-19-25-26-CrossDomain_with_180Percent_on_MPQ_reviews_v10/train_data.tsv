1282	negative	such a conspiracy will become counterproductive and boomerang on the Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati.
927	neutral	(Mandela) came as a very militant leader of the Youth League. He turned tables around, he was absolutely as intolerant in a way to our leaders as Julius Malema is now,
1093	neutral	I wish that the year 1388 be the year of peace, happiness and prosperity for all Afghans. A large pole adorned with colourful flags was then hoisted-a key moment broadcast live on television during which some believe prayers can be answered and miracles happen. Many of the estimated 10,000 people who packed their shrine for the event told AFP they would pray for peace. Others like Ahmad Shah asked for good health or prosperity. I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,

1519	neutral	I think that the case of our councilors is ripe to go even before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Before, I respected the principle that the state must not be sued, even when Miloševi? stole from us [Radicals] in Kosovo taking 50 mandates, but now the situation is different,

1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,

489	neutral	We have always supported him as a president of the European Commission, he has been a good president for the interests of Spain,
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
1181	positive	This is an important step for us as a standalone business. It also confirms our determination as a team to steer Jaguar Land Rover through these extraordinary and challenging times, so that our business is ready to take advantage when the downturn finally ends.

984	neutral	The transfer of authority from elected local councils to a new quango, which will make more planning decisions than in any other National Park, is a step in precisely the wrong direction at a time when local communities should be given more of a say over their own affairs, not less. 'I therefore intend to keep the effectiveness of the new park under review, in particular the accountability arrangements, to ensure that communities retain local control over decisions affecting their own area. 'There is no gua
460	negative	Its culture is extermist, is radical, is hostile, denies Israel's right to exist, and it belongs more in the camp of the Taliban and al Qaeda and the Moslem Brotherhoods of the world, all of which are very, very uncompromising. What can we do?
484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission. It is a test of Barroso's courage and conviction. Today should be an important day in the history of international financial markets - but we shall see if the current conservative European Commission is capable of taking the recommended steps.
86	neutral	My position is the same, my position is not going to change. The Congress party candidate for prime minister is Manmohan Singh. What more can I say?

80	neutral	I will discuss it with Mandela,
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations. The Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deserve praise for sending a strong warning signal to the UN. Unfortunately, the efforts by the U.S. administration to ameliorate this process have not succeeded,
1537	neutral	Bastrykin praised highly the joint work of the SKP main investigation department in the Southern Federal District, the Federal Security Service and the Interior Ministry, which unmasked all members of the criminal group involved in the foresaid crimes.

43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.

767	neutral	I did not negotiate, settle or approve Sir Fred Goodwin's departure terms. All these issues were handled by RBS,
770	neutral	given the serious pressure that the Irish Prison Service has been experiencing during the last 12 to 18 months, in 2008 it became necessary to introduce additional contingency accommodation through the doubling up of cells in Mountjoy, Wheatfield, Cloverhill, Midlands and Arbour Hill Prisons and in the Training Unit.

591	neutral	Since June 2003, the European Union only allows imports of chilli products which have been tested and are certified to be free from contamination by the Sudan 1 dye. In addition, Member States are obliged to carry out surveillance of the products on the market. This system has proved its worth as since its introduction, several hundred contaminated products have been found on the market or at our borders, and have been recalled and destroyed.
353	neutral	I wish to express my sincere condolences to the families, friends and comrades of the two soldiers who were tragically murdered last night (Saturday) and those who were injured. My thoughts are with them all at this extremely difficult time. Northern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said there must not be any retaliation for the attack. He said:

1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

170	neutral	Mr Le Pen's negationist remarks, reiterated once again in the European Parliament, disqualify him from chairing the inaugural session of our institution for even a second,
204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab

1416	neutral	The Taleban can't beat us. They don't pose a tactical or strategic threat to Nato and Isaf forces.
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.
637	neutral	The MPC of the South African Reserve Bank will from now onwards meet according to the schedule below.
