802	negative	The main fault lies with the Interior Ministry that did not submit even fundamental evidence. The NSS´s decision is therefore not a verdict on the Workers´ Party, but a verdict testifying to the Interior Ministry´s and Minister Langer´s incompetence,

He added that what has been said about the concern for unity and independence of Iraq, the constitutional review and national reconciliation, in addition to

246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
1157	neutral	It is ironic to link this convoy with Hamas though we're still unsure if there was a convoy bombed by airplanes,
243	neutral	This is a win-win measure. It will save energy, cut emissions, bring down fuel bills for the most vulnerable in society and help the construction industry and SMEs in particular. We hope that the Council and the European Parliament will adopt this proposal without delay and that member states will move quickly to set up schemes to harness this investment.
353	neutral	I wish to express my sincere condolences to the families, friends and comrades of the two soldiers who were tragically murdered last night (Saturday) and those who were injured. My thoughts are with them all at this extremely difficult time. Northern Ireland's First Minister and DUP leader Peter Robinson said there must not be any retaliation for the attack. He said:

198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,

336	neutral	Eastern Congo has been mired in conflict since Rwanda's genocide nearly 15 years ago spilled war across the border and Hutu militias sought refuge here. Nkunda contends he was defending the region's minority Tutsis against the Rwandan Hutus. In a rare move by former enemies, Congolese and Rwandan forces drove out about 600 of the Hutu militias fighters earlier this year and the Congolese army hoped to force out 400 more by the end of March, said Kudura Kasongo, the Congolese presidential spokesman.

The European Commission is working closely with the Czech authorities to ensure that they make the most of the EU structural and cohesion funds, in order to boost competitiveness and create jobs.

1395	positive	I think we can conclude that there is a fresh wind in NATO, and also, hopefully, a new atmosphere of cooperation,
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.

The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.
184	neutral	It will be an interesting match against Roddick,

468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,

707	neutral	I have prepared a legal proposal that would explain and clear the Presidential immunity, as it is improperly defined by the Constitution. Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

339	negative	We are left to look back and say that Wagoner's appointment as both chairman and CEO in 2003 was little more than an act to ensure the dynasty of GM boardroom arrogance and failure continued,
438	neutral	the White House intends to reissue a regulation that will be very similar, requiring cash be paid before it goes.
1204	neutral	NHS staff have been absolutely clear that if the 48 hour working week is imposed on them it will leave many junior doctors with insufficient experience from their training. It will also threaten the care that patients receive because there will not be the same continuity of care and because smaller surgical teams will have to be shut down.
760	negative	I don't think it's appropriate that the taxpayer should be providing any more benefits to Fred Goodwin.

262	neutral	We intend to raise this violation of the UN Security Council resolution, if it goes forward, in the UN,
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,
783	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
735	negative	The appointment of Dennis Ross, whose track record shows his unacceptable radical viewpoints about Iran, is inconsistent with Mr. Obama's claims about his willingness to create change in Iran-US relations and contains no positive messages for Iran,

865	neutral	The compromise formula has been worked out with Zardari,
30	neutral	Because he was voted for as [Putin's] successor, he has to maintain a balance between continuity and his liberal initiatives,

303	neutral	As far as the expectations I had for a president who is a pro-choice president and did not share my pro-life views, President Obama has been honest about what he intended to do and has done those things,
1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area. It is a major problem that fish which could be used as food are discarded, and the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs has put a lot of effort to address this issue over the last year,

456	neutral	I think it's the safe haven on the Pakistani side of the border, not just for Al-Qaeda but for the Taliban for the Hakani network, for Gulbaddin Hekmatyar and other affiliated groups that are all working together — they're separate groups, but they're all working together, and I think as long as they have a safe haven to operate there, it's going to be a problem for us,
58	negative	One of the side-effects of quantitative easing will be a negative impact on pension funds and pensioners. Yet again pensioners are having to pay the price for Gordon Brown's age of irresponsibility.
1181	positive	This is an important step for us as a standalone business. It also confirms our determination as a team to steer Jaguar Land Rover through these extraordinary and challenging times, so that our business is ready to take advantage when the downturn finally ends.
1516	neutral	If the Government meets the ultimatum of the Alliance for Georgia and calls a referendum, the rest of the opposition will join the initiative.
