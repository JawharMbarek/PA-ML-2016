198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,

848	neutral	I can 100 per cent categorically deny any knowledge that Mr Chambers had decided to take performance-enhancing drugs.

The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008.

448	negative	Now there will be efforts to come up with an excuse not to register the dangerous candidates -- primarily Nemtsov and Lebedev. They might let Lugovoi in, although that, of course, would be a bit of a scandal for the election,

984	neutral	The transfer of authority from elected local councils to a new quango, which will make more planning decisions than in any other National Park, is a step in precisely the wrong direction at a time when local communities should be given more of a say over their own affairs, not less.

If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov

297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.

1178	neutral	Murr opposed the obstruction of the presidential elections. He supported Bkirki and its principles, which were violated. The development of his position led to rapprochement. However, this possibility does not mean that we authorized MP Murr to form alliances in the Metn. His vision of the [electoral] battle in the Metn is different from ours,
1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,

1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,
43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.

1072	neutral	It is a very pragmatic country and while it may be arguing with the UK about Alexander Litvinenko [the former KGB agent killed in London] it doesn't mean that they won't be closely watching what the government is doing. The Russian government has earmarked $280bn [£200bn] for financial support in the banking system.
1579	negative	Our direct problem is not with the Free Patriotic Movement, but in the alliance and political line chosen by the FPM.

197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
1137	positive	We need to talk to Hamas to make progress (toward peace) because they represent a big proportion of the Palestinians.
1073	positive	It seems the IRS and Treasury Department went out of their way to knock out an emerging, effective and evenhanded way to collect tax debt that the IRS will otherwise never collect,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February.

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

627	negative	A gathering of friends in the chairman's room at the Defense Ministry is not a legal gathering of the party secretariat, and in any case there is no validity to a decision made at a bizarre gathering in which even the secretary general is not present,
