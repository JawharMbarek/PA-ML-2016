1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
183_ 38	neutral	) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
89_ 17	neutral	In talking with other parents, I get the same feedback - as babies get older and become toddlers, ALL DIAPER PAILS become gradually less and less effective until they are just no longer useful.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
213_ 10	positive	+Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
189_ 38	neutral	And all you do is select all the tracks in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the File Explorer window.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
225_ 30	neutral	going into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
211_ 26	positive	Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
268_ 31	positive	All in all, this is a great phone.
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
32_ 16	neutral	Another is the ability to upload images from your PC to a memory  card in the camera.
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
256_ 6	negative	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
85_ 2	positive	Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
189_ 12	neutral	1.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
195_ 28	positive	I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
79_ 7	neutral	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
136_ 10	neutral	Not even one glitch.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
