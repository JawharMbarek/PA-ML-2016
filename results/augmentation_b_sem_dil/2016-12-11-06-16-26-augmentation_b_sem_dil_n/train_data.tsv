287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)

238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".

115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
189_ 12	neutral	1.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
58_ 0	neutral	My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
