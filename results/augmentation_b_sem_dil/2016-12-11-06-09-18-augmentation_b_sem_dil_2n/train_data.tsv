287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)

238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".

115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
189_ 12	neutral	1.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
213_ 13	negative	It DOES take some getting used to.
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
298_ 3	negative	We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
36_ 17	negative	8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
212_ 1	neutral	Comments such as "it's stylish" or "it looks cool" or "everyone has it" don't nesseseraly make something good.
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
108_ 5	positive	The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
144_ 1	negative	However, this product performed well below my expectation.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
132_ 513	neutral	 I have no clue why this happens, as they show up perfectly in my iTunes library and there was no interruption during the uploads.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
204_ 0	positive	This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
58_ 0	neutral	My daughter is now 2 and 1/2, and I am still enjoying this product.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
178_ 8	neutral	When you open the package the first thing you see is "Run CD first".
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
191_ 26	neutral	Plus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
161_ 1	negative	I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
233_ 23	positive	5.The Camera installed on this phone is awesome.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
230_ 1	negative	Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
132_ 523	neutral	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
83_ 6	positive	I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
0_ 195	neutral	I use "get ready" and "here it comes".
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
144_ 9	positive	In addition it is very easy to setup.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
47_ 1	neutral	The Canon S100 destroys this problem.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
78_ 2	neutral	Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
207_ 16	neutral	My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
193_ 0	neutral	I first signed up for Napster on line.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
276_ 6	negative	I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
193_ 18	neutral	Its a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
166_ 34	neutral	With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, "the wireless connection".
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
243_ 21	negative	Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
229_ 9	positive	As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'.
192_ 0	neutral	Update 8/11/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
0_ 120	neutral	I would not deny that some cameras are not treated with care.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
38_ 1	positive	This camera is great, wonderfully small, and has attactive hi-tech casing.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
178_ 10	neutral	Somehow the adap
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
240_ 10	positive	Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
256_ 8	neutral	Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
0_ 6	neutral	If you want something resembling a REAL and professional review before plunking down your $500.00, I suggest going to dpreview or dcresource and reading the reviews there.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
256_ 5	negative	My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
307_ 10	neutral	And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
78_ 0	negative	But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
174_ 13	neutral	MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
132_ 486	negative	Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
54_ 12	neutral	Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
166_ 39	neutral	Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
233_ 16	neutral	I upgraded mine to a 128 MB MMC Card via which I can store unlimited number of messages, take a thousand pictures and videos.
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
79_ 7	neutral	For diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
316_ 2	negative	However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
242_ 4	neutral	Not for the impatient.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
0_ 45	neutral	Wrong, except that my problems are different.
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
257_ 4	neutral	Motorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
