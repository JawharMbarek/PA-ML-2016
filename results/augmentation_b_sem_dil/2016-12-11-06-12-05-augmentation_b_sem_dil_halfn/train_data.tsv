287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
225_ 54	neutral	jack that Creative has acknowledge.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
15_ 18	negative	The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
307_ 14	neutral	Nice little racket they've got there.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)

238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
190_ 26	neutral	Otherwise, you should get an ipod.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
225_ 14	positive	Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".

115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
132_ 59	negative	 The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
138_ 14	neutral	If I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
132_ 109	neutral	 This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
189_ 12	neutral	1.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
307_ 8	positive	This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
178_ 0	neutral	First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
123_ 6	neutral	It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 291	neutral	First of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look "uncool."
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
319_ 1	positive	The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
36_ 18	negative	Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
209_ 21	neutral	To minimize any frustration (and the odds that you may return a usable unit), keep the following in mind:  1. While your unit is!
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
243_ 1	neutral	In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
174_ 19	neutral	WPA is best.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
132_ 269	negative	 Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
131_ 3	neutral	First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
199_ 10	neutral	A few reviewers have also complained about the printed manual which is probably one of the biggest wastes of paper ever included with an electronic device.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
263_ 3	neutral	yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
255_ 12	positive	I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
132_ 314	neutral	 At $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
188_ 6	negative	i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
