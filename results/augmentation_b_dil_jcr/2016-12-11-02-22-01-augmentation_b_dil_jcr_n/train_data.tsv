488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission.

123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
66_ 7	positive	It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
170_ 13	neutral	At first I was going to give it a really bad review.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
142_ 13	neutral	  !
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
132_ 322	neutral	 The ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
36_ 7	neutral	I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
312_ 5	neutral	If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.

190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.

201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
201_ 32	positive	- Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!

139_ 3	neutral	People that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.

146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.

23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.

193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.

287_ 17	neutral	Since then, I have had one problem after another.
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
190_ 5	neutral	I decided to go with the convienence factor and purchase a creative zen micro.
179_ 2	neutral	I would never get 108M rate unless I was half a meter from the box.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.

105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
0_ 92	neutral	(i can't help but play with the camera always)
320_ 2	neutral	Then I disabled both Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
18_ 1	negative	 the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.

247_ 0	positive	this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.

193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
91_ 0	neutral	 We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
142_ 3	neutral	I got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
