VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)

VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.

VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.

MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.

MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.

231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
323_ 1	neutral	About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
132_ 175	positive	  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
