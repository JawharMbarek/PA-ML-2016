1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.

217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.

263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.

209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.

36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.

0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
