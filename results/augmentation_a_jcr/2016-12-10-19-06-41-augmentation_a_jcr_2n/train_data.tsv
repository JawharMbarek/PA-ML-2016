1151	neutral	A new language towards the region is coming from President Obama. The challenge for everybody is for this to be the prelude for a genuine change in U.S. and European policies. Regarding an official opening towards Hamas, it's a matter of time,

941	neutral	As for winning the Champions League twice, the first time was at the beginning of my career. Now I'm getting a little grey towards the end of my career. It would be perfect. As for the players, you just have to see their reaction this morning when they heard the news.

622	negative	If Alan Johnson had intervened a year ago when his Department knew of the Healthcare Commission's urgent concerns about how badly [Stafford] hospital was failing patients, he could have secured the removal of the chief executive and ensured there was no reward for failure.

766	neutral	There is a formal contractual relationship between Sir Fred Goodwin and the bank.
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1351	neutral	It is a one-day visit, it's a very normal visit from one president to another. He is responding to an invitation by President Issaias Afeworki,

457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1515	neutral	The internet has changed politics - changed it utterly and forever. What caught their attention? To be honest, I'm slightly perplexed. I have been making similar speeches every week and posting them on YouTube for the past seven months.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins.

1342	neutral	Well, I guess Rush Limbaugh was busy, so they trotted out the next most popular member of the Republican cabal,
922	neutral	in Pakistan. General David Petraeus, the US military commander for the region, and Richard Holbrooke, the special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan, will brief lawmakers Thursday on Pakistan's political crisis, Kerry said, , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.

1306	positive	It is a commendable achievement that Air Zimbabwe successfully completed its final audit process on December 15, 2008, ahead of the IATA deadline of December 31, 2008, during a harsh, restrictive economic climate,
588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,

I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
126_ 13	neutral	this camera will stay with me for years !
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
137_ 3	neutral	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
227_ 46	neutral	2 .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
200_ 22	neutral	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
290_ 36	neutral	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
140_ 6	positive	the moveable lcd screen is great .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :

221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .

ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
250307578888867841	neutral	Be sure to follow the #Coyotes affiliate in the American Hockey League  - @PortlandPirates. They start training camp on Saturday.

262371021275930624	negative	@LiterallyFedUp  4 dead Americans in #Benghazi apparently are a lesser tragedy than death of Trayvon Martin may he RIP.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
225_ 45	negative	because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
67_ 3	neutral	Presto!
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
93_ 11	neutral	Makes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
199_ 8	neutral	My preference for the touchpad sensitivity setting is 'medium'.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
195_ 1	neutral	Space : 5GB =2500 songs.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
36_ 8	neutral	3- USB kicks!
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
0_ 150	positive	it's fast, feels great in your hand and looks great too.
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
184_ 4	positive	I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
256_ 6	negative	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
