DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
BOOKS_11_8	negative	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.

ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
BOOKS_4_8	negative	Patricia, please retire with some dignity!
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
DVDS_57_7	positive	Electrifying Nicholson!
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_72_0	neutral	Pros: Inexpensive, generally takes nice pictures ... Cons: Not very sturdy, difficult to obtain recommended accessories, worthless customer service.
DVDS_56_6	positive	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_59_2	negative	The selection of widgets available on the TV are poor, and limited.
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
DVDS_35_8	negative	No one will ever be able to capture the beauty of Lolita on film and I hope this is the last time they try.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
BOOKS_10_3	negative	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
ELECTRONICS_71_11	negative	Around the second month I had this phone, the charger broke.
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
BOOKS_14_5	negative	I didn't get the island at all.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
BOOKS_1_5	neutral	For an introduction read Neural Networks by Kevin Gurney. He puts great emphasis on conceptual understanding.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
DVDS_38_26	negative	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
DVDS_52_18	positive	But it truly is Garner's showcase to depict her girl-next-door sexiness not unlike America's sweetheart Julia Roberts: a gal whose femininity and sexuality are not in disposable even if she is one of the guys.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
BOOKS_3_4	negative	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
DVDS_57_1	positive	Raw and devilishly good with some insight of anger in males in all of cinema.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
ELECTRONICS_67_3	negative	They told me to download the newest firmware and helpfully sent me to a link to an iso image which didn't work.
DVDS_51_1	positive	Perhaps this, one of his best roles to date, will change perspectives overall.
VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
BOOKS_8_0	negative	I thought at first maybe I had a defective version of the book but after reading other reviews, I see that our problem is normal.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
DVDS_38_33	negative	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
DVDS_45_3	negative	I think a large majority of the effect was lost in making this movie in color.
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
BOOKS_10_13	positive	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
DVDS_37_9	negative	The ending was disappointing.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
DVDS_57_6	positive	President Kennedy used to drink it!""
BOOKS_14_3	positive	He put into words my feelings when he said, ""I just want to love God"" to the three religious leaders (Catholic, Muslim, Hindu) when they asked him why he practiced all three religions.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
DVDS_53_13	positive	Both make you feel for their desperation and ultimately their last-ditch efforts of keeping their sanities in lock-step.
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
BOOKS_3_1	negative	It wasn't worth the wait.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
ELECTRONICS_69_6	neutral	Lots of other little things annoy me with it but it does its job.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
DVDS_46_7	positive	8/10 big ups for Ali. Respect!
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
DVDS_38_22	negative	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out ""OOOOOooooowwww!""
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
DVDS_31_4	negative	I'm not even going to include the lame cast and simply say the directors : Michael & Peter Spierig should just give it all up and stop while they're behind.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
ELECTRONICS_66_4	positive	You did not mention the 16gb memory that comes with the T-Mobile phone without extra charge.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
DVDS_37_7	negative	But besides that, the movie was terrible.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
BOOKS_19_2	negative	The mans voice on the cd isn't very soothing.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
DVDS_36_22	negative	Exactly!
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
BOOKS_20_0	neutral	Umm...it was interesting, but I couldn't get into it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
DVDS_32_6	negative	Although Blalock is a real hottie, the shameful way her character is depicted as either a 'sista pretending to be white' or vice versea as some sort of living-in-the-shadows- chameleon is only further drummed over the head by the ham-fisted direction by Wayne Beach in his debut as a helmsman and also the film's scribe.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
BOOKS_6_2	negative	which was so very prominent in her ""Walk"" is missing.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
ELECTRONICS_64_0	positive	Pros: For the most part, a very decent printer.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
ELECTRONICS_58_4	negative	Display cracked after two days.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
DVDS_38_27	negative	Her ""woo-hoo!""
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
DVDS_36_24	negative	It's just bad.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
DVDS_38_17	negative	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
DVDS_38_25	negative	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
DVDS_54_3	positive	Opening with Gideon being shot in the arm and running through the wintry landscape, falling into a freezing river and eventually excising the silver-dollar sized bullet with wincing dexterity, the pace continues to be breathless and anticipatory as Gideon manages to be one-step ahead while Carver's troupe are two-behind.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
BOOKS_16_20	negative	The book also fails to explore the relationship between Christopher and his mother even though his bond with his father has been explained well enough.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
DVDS_44_9	negative	A lot of action movies have the unbelievability factor, but for me, i actually found myself thinking how bull***** this movie was.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
DVDS_32_9	negative	That's never a good sign and another is shamefully stealing from a real classic.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
BOOKS_11_9	negative	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
DVDS_45_2	negative	This is the reason that this movie should not have been re-made.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
BOOKS_18_14	negative	Though Ishmael does present some good examples, I didn't find the text powerfull enough to convince me.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
ELECTRONICS_65_5	negative	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
DVDS_56_7	positive	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes â€“ alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
DVDS_48_9	negative	Lastly, I felt betrayed by the ending that left questions unanswered.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
DVDS_52_3	positive	Her more feminine wiles on display to the hilt in this surprisingly charming romantic dramedy with her character Gray Wheeler, a young woman facing a sudden tragedy, her fiancÃ©e is killed in a horrible sporting event accident crushing her upcoming nuptials in full blossom.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
BOOKS_25_3	positive	He goes through the relationships with everyone he meets and his thoughts while reviewing for the race before it's start in Anchorage, Alaska. Paulsen is one of my all time favorite authors and when i read this I was impressed with the emotion, and hysterical hallucinations and I was glad that this book went way over my expectations.
ELECTRONICS_67_5	negative	Not to mention the link they provided was to the 9650 not the 9550. Finally when I upgraded the firmware and it didn't solve the issue, I was sent to ""level 3"" support.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
DVDS_37_6	positive	I laughed a bit.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
BOOKS_1_2	negative	The author hasn't even taken the trouble to put up an errata list.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
ELECTRONICS_63_6	negative	I've heard them better, but far away from good.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
BOOKS_9_12	negative	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
DVDS_31_5	negative	Atrocious!
DVDS_48_6	negative	This is only a smidgen of several ""beyond belief"" scenarios that just frustrated the heck out of me.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
BOOKS_3_5	positive	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
BOOKS_10_5	negative	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
BOOKS_28_2	positive	I definitely liked Kite Runner more, but I did like this one a lot.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
DVDS_29_3	positive	Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
BOOKS_22_0	positive	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
ELECTRONICS_67_10	negative	Later trying to decide what to do about this problem, I realized that this was a malfunctioning product and they they should take it back.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
BOOKS_21_3	positive	I find this little book practical, honest and helpful.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
ELECTRONICS_60_7	negative	I ended up having to manually configure everything just to get the iBook to see the router, then get it on the 'Net, using wires and wireless.
DVDS_41_16	positive	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
VIDEOGAMES_134_35	negative	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
DVDS_53_11	positive	Rockwell, one of my personal faves and perhaps the most underrated of his (and my) generation, is excellent.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
ELECTRONICS_67_9	negative	I don't mind dealing with pearl scripts, but it wasn't supported and he wouldn't tell me anything about what the script did, so it wasn't that helpful.
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
DVDS_36_7	negative	Wow. What a concept.
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
BOOKS_26_7	negative	I believe that most readers would have rather read about Vincentes experience in nuclear power plants with all its technical complexity than being bored by his fabricated and dull pump system.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
BOOKS_7_22	negative	I would hate to see such a sad effort get enough unintentional support that they allow, let alone recruit BH to write a third book.
DVDS_52_16	positive	Grant does allow some refreshing touches, namely making her characters likable yet flawed and not jerks, which so easily could've been the case in many plot points (ie Garner's mother-in-law-to-be has the inklings of villainy but really deep down shows she is not the heartless wench she appears when things get a little dicey).
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
DVDS_53_16	negative	However the film's final moment feels like a cop out and not an entirely believable close to an otherwise unnerving, nasty slice of the American Dream becoming the American Nightmare.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
BOOKS_3_12	negative	But it's too little, too late.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
ELECTRONICS_71_8	negative	- The phone scratches very easily and does not handle being dropped very well.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
BOOKS_19_6	positive	I would probably recommend it to a friend.
DVDS_46_1	negative	However, I is a little disappointed about dis movie.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
ELECTRONICS_220_2	neutral	Maybe I've not set it up correctly.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
ELECTRONICS_60_2	neutral	Four days later and lots of e-mails to Linksys support (which were quick at responding) and I finally got it working.
ELECTRONICS_62_4	negative	Could not find any where to put in a claim.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
DVDS_35_2	neutral	I believe Irons could have been a good Humbert if the screenplay had been batter.
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
BOOKS_1_6	neutral	For further studies there is Neural Networks by Simon Haykin, which has the mathematics.
ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
DVDS_53_2	positive	Well the answer is not necessarily found in this disturbing, under-the-skin creepy socio-horror film focusing on an NYC Yuppie couple's newborn daughter brought back to their upscale Central Park West environs and their preternaturally bright, but clearly unstable, young son, Joshua (newcomer Kogan, a real find).
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
DVDS_36_5	negative	The story was weak and beaten to death.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
BOOKS_17_4	negative	The end just happens, as if the author is in a hurry to make it happen or lacks better imagination.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
DVDS_49_8	positive	Keep an eye on this naturally gifted young actress.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
