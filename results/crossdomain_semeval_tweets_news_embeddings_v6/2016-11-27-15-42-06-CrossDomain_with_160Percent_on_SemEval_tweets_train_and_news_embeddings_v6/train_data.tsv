But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2

When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,

'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time.

Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy.

DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
DVDS_49_7	positive	There is a certain magical charm that works between her and Day-Lewis that is both tragic and inspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
DVDS_50_6	positive	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
BOOKS_4_4	negative	What a letdown.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
DVDS_55_11	positive	But if you want a decent ghost story on a secluded evening check this out.
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
DVDS_38_34	negative	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
DVDS_53_9	neutral	The strong acting by the leads buoys the borderline black comedy/camp factor by a thread when the suspense is driven by filmmaker Ratliff, in his first feature film - he helmed HELL HOUSE, a docu on a Christian amusement park aimed at scaring sinners straight â€“ whose screenplay with David Gilbert, another rookie, drives the reality based terror of the aforementioned post-partum depression, family responsibility and the defense mechanism of survival by any means.
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
DVDS_48_8	neutral	What must be also said is that, had this film brought together the realism to the high caliber of all the things that did work then this could have been one heck of a film.
DVDS_56_0	positive	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
BOOKS_27_1	positive	It is easy to read and has all the essentials.
DVDS_54_8	positive	But director David Von Ancken making his big-screen debut (a TV vet of such shows as ""Numb3rs"" & ""CSI: NY"") â€“ who collaborated on the script with novice Abby Everett Jaques â€“ manages to incorporate some shrewd machinations (a dead horse sequence that actually had me jump out of my seat; kudos to editor Conrad Buff IV) and allow his leads enough space to make the most of their environs (the scenery is a character itself going from the wintry mountains to the arid, no-man's land salt flats) to their advantage.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
ELECTRONICS_68_1	negative	The display is plain manual is quite complex.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
ELECTRONICS_62_2	negative	It quit working just two days ago, so i called Lexmark support and they had me clean the rollers, but this did'nt work.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
BOOKS_6_4	negative	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
ELECTRONICS_60_10	negative	Hopefully now it is running I won't need to do that again, and getting the other machines connected will be easier.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_15_2	negative	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
DVDS_36_4	negative	Obviously, the script was bought and the writer was not brought aboard to work on it as the film went on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
ELECTRONICS_68_2	negative	I did have issues with sound from my TV as well.
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
ELECTRONICS_72_4	positive	I have been able to take more than 30 pictures with a fully charged pair of batteries before they went dead, and it is simple to just carry a spare pair of batteries for backup, as the battery charger that came with the camera accommodates 4 batteries.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
BOOKS_27_2	positive	With a proper dictionary like Payne Smith's Compendious Syriac Dictionary there is little else you need for classical Syriac. Beginning with the script and pronunciation it advances through pronouns, nouns and verbs in a very orderly fashion.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
BOOKS_3_8	negative	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_67_2	negative	When I called them to solve this problem, it was horrible.
ELECTRONICS_209_1	negative	It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
BOOKS_24_7	neutral	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
DVDS_44_6	negative	But then you have the ""Lola"" who looks like a man and the love between Darius Stone and Lola is sooo unbelievable.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
DVDS_38_29	negative	""OOOOoow!""
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
BOOKS_15_1	positive	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
DVDS_44_5	negative	You have the new XXX (Ice Cube) who no matter how good is acting is is a pimp!
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
BOOKS_23_7	positive	Particularly touching is the scene in which the Hero explains race to his six-year-old, bi-racial daughter.
ELECTRONICS_73_0	neutral	Pros: Many features, rapid rewind/fast-forward on VCR. ... Cons: Remote control somewhat difficult to learn to use, Sony service and exchange policies awful.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
DVDS_49_0	positive	IFC produced indie gem with great, subtle acting and impressive novella-type narrative with characters as the film's focal point: to wit, former idealized hippie Jack Slavin (a never been better Daniel Day-Lewis) who lives with his tween daughter Rose (bewitched, beguiled and bewildered newcomer Camilla Belle) in their shared abandoned commune he created with her mother (who left them when she was very young) on a small remote e 'island off the East Coast of the United States' (as the beginning title card tells us over the amusing ""I Put A Spell On You"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival appropriately setting the tone).
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
DVDS_39_8	neutral	A haggard looking Leigh also shocks in her seemingly drugged turn before the film's end.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
DVDS_57_0	positive	THE LAST DETAIL (1973) **** Jack Nicholson, Randy Quaid, Otis Young, Carol Kane, Michael Moriarty, Clifton James, Nancy Allen, Gilda Radner. Nicholson is nothing short of brilliant in Hal Ashby's film about two career Navy officers assigned to escort prisoner Quaid to the brig on bogus charges, with some off the beaten trail adventures to make the best of the situation.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
BOOKS_27_3	positive	A lot of information is presented in tables which is handy for reference.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
BOOKS_7_19	negative	;-) Final analysis: This is beyond a doubt the most boring book I have EVER READ!
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
ELECTRONICS_61_4	negative	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
BOOKS_16_21	neutral	The only charcters that are well developed are Christoper and his father.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
BOOKS_1_4	negative	There are better books.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
DVDS_54_5	positive	Both actors give finely tuned turns here with Brosnan in one of his most physically demanding performances with a certain dirt-under-the-fingernails grittiness, sporting a Don Quixote VanDyke and thatch of graying hair, a grizzled wrinkling pre-aged look that suggests his suffering character is damned in the long run.
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
BOOKS_17_3	neutral	That is the weak point, the waterloo, the pearl harbour for this otherwise great plot.
DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.
DVDS_36_1	negative	In this film, there are too many problems to list.
DVDS_51_10	positive	The gift of gab has never been so enjoyable.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
ELECTRONICS_69_5	negative	sometimes reaching the top of the tablet to reach the top of the screen is tiring (as someone with limited mobility).
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
BOOKS_14_1	positive	I liked the first part.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
ELECTRONICS_72_9	negative	The instruction manual states that when transferring pictures from the camera to the computer, you should use an AC adapter that does not come with the camera, but which is available in the ""Gateway Digital Camera Accessory Kit."" Good luck finding such a kit!
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
VIDEOGAMES_271_10	negative	Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
ELECTRONICS_68_0	neutral	Pros: Quality Cons: Not User Friendly I bought this receiver and it does the job, but not the most exciting.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
DVDS_41_8	neutral	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
BOOKS_9_0	neutral	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
BOOKS_27_4	negative	The exercises are very basic.
DVDS_37_2	negative	The film slowly led into some elaborate heist of some sword which was worth a lot of money.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_72_7	positive	First the good news...the camera takes nice, sharp pictures when zoom is not used and there is good lighting; it is compact and lightweight; and it is the most inexpensive camera I've seen with both digital and optical zoom and 4 megapixels.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
DVDS_35_1	negative	They try to make Humbert too sympathetic instead of a monster, when really he is a sympathetic monster, and that is the beauty of the novel Lolita, one moment you hate him the next you feel bad for him.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
ELECTRONICS_71_9	negative	I drop mine once and ever since its made this horrible buzzing noise.
VIDEOGAMES_135_3	positive	It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!
MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
DVDS_51_0	positive	TALK TO ME (2007) *** Don Cheadle, Chiwtel Ejiofor, Taraji P. Henson, Martin Sheen, Cedric the Entertainer, Vondie Curtis-Hall, Mike Epps. (Dir: Kasi Lemmons) Cheadle Sparkles in Biopic Don Cheadle is perhaps the most underrated best actor of his generation giving it all in every film performance and not getting the true props and recognition for his craft of versatility.
DVDS_44_0	positive	The only good actors in this movie is Willem Dafoe and Jackson.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
DVDS_37_13	negative	I give it 3 out of 10 (and that only because Deniro and Norton are two of my personal favorites)
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
BOOKS_11_0	positive	This is a really cool story.
BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
DVDS_39_10	neutral	In this second cousin to ""Dollhouse"" the film doesn't cohese easily as its far superior black comic/tragic predecessor but its meanness is all too-apparent as well as the political agenda of what is wrong with America (read: abortion and the Right Wing Christian sects right-to-lifers) yet Aviva does get across one true theme: we are not who we seem to be.
BOOKS_13_2	negative	Blood spurting?
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
BOOKS_11_6	positive	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
BOOKS_24_12	positive	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
DVDS_44_4	negative	I thought it was going to be much better.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
DVDS_51_7	positive	She has a good command for her actors allowing each one to shine like the formidably funny and fierce Henson as Petey's vulgar yet golden-hearted hoochie mama.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
ELECTRONICS_69_7	positive	A good beginner's tablet.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
BOOKS_9_9	negative	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
ELECTRONICS_70_3	neutral	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
BOOKS_2_0	negative	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
BOOKS_16_19	negative	We have all read books, watched plays or movies of handicapped children who undertake huge tasks and complete them.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
BOOKS_19_4	negative	Maybe a woman's voice would have been better.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
ELECTRONICS_66_1	neutral	The Apps issue is not so bad.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
DVDS_43_13	positive	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of ""FINAL DESTINATION 2"") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
BOOKS_12_31	negative	But personally I much prefer the writing of LM Montgomery over Paulo Coelho. I didn't come to love the characters in â€œThe Alchemistâ€? as I did the characters from Avonlea.
BOOKS_8_5	neutral	My 18 month old LOVES the book and will sit and play with it for extended periods of time, however, the batteries just don't hold out long enough for the toy to be worth the money.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
DVDS_57_4	positive	Best line: ""Heineken?
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
ELECTRONICS_71_4	neutral	When I first got it, I was pretty pleased with it.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
DVDS_42_7	negative	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave ""Better Luck Tomorrow"" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
BOOKS_11_7	positive	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
BOOKS_16_6	positive	The book is so well written and the story has been narrated in such convincing tone, that at times I had to make sure that Mark was not writing his autobiography!
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
DVDS_38_14	negative	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
DVDS_36_12	negative	The continuity alone is enough to drive the average viewer insane.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
BOOKS_11_2	positive	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
BOOKS_7_14	negative	Couldn't think of a challenging bad guy?
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
DVDS_38_28	negative	-ing and shouting...and yelling ""Yeah!""
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
BOOKS_17_5	neutral	CONCLUSION: READABLE if you have nothing else to read.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
BOOKS_2_3	negative	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
DVDS_38_36	negative	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
ELECTRONICS_71_5	negative	But then I started to pick out all the bad things about it.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
DVDS_42_6	neutral	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
DVDS_50_5	positive	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
BOOKS_19_3	negative	There are parts where it's quiet for a few minutes and then when he starts talking again, it's more startling due to the tone of his voice.
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
DVDS_37_8	negative	The most ""exciting"" scene of the movie dragged out for what seemed to be hours.
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
DVDS_52_1	neutral	(Dir: Susannah Grant) Jennifer is a great ""catch"" and the film isn't half bad either.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
ELECTRONICS_71_13	negative	Now it wont charge at all.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
DVDS_38_39	negative	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
DVDS_32_8	negative	It doesn't help that the film has been on the shelf for several year.
DVDS_50_4	positive	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
DVDS_52_15	neutral	Maybe that's a bit refreshing or I'ma tad too cynical (or maybe I was just hoping for a cat fight).
MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
ELECTRONICS_67_1	negative	A few months after using it, it stopped RAIDing across automatically.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
BOOKS_11_1	positive	I loved the strong, independent main character.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
DVDS_37_0	negative	Spoiler Alert One would think a movie featuring Robert Deniro and Edward Norton would be good.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
DVDS_52_19	positive	The film is worth a look at to see how one can find their happiness even if it comes with little burden.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
ELECTRONICS_68_5	negative	I took it back and got a Harmon/Kardon (AVR-247)for the same price and I feel it blows this one away.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
ELECTRONICS_61_3	negative	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
ELECTRONICS_64_5	negative	I cannot think of a more retarded feature...
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
ELECTRONICS_65_4	negative	It's awful!
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
ELECTRONICS_63_1	positive	It's very comfortable to charge - the charger is in the socket, the headset is in the charger, no tangling wires - great!
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_59_7	negative	PS there is a Sudoku widget - so you can play Sudoku on the TV (as I said ealier - don't waste your money).
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
DVDS_37_11	negative	What?!? Come on, that was ridiculous.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
BOOKS_5_14	negative	I raced through rest of the 300 pages in another hour and I haven't missed anything!
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
DVDS_31_1	negative	Robert Rodriguez camera angles, ""Matrix"" type pacings and Peter Jackson's seminal ""DeadAlive"" to name three counts of plagiarism) far too many hybrids and quite frankly a real mess overall.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
DVDS_50_0	positive	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's ""Pushing Tin"" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
DVDS_36_15	negative	Am I asking too much in asking to SOME thought process while developing this film?
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
ELECTRONICS_61_1	negative	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
DVDS_38_21	negative	You cannot belly dance in your ""perky step aerobics instructor"" persona.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
ELECTRONICS_65_7	negative	Terrible design.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
BOOKS_18_1	positive	Told through interactions of a master and his student, Ishmael presents a view of history in a very different, and for some the real, light.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
BOOKS_23_8	positive	After a violent start, the story develops at a more livable pace, building the characters and events to climax in the Hero's gut-wrenching search for the Heroine and their daughter, both kidnaped by the sadistic, murdering Rapist. SHANGHAIED HEART's setting and plot give the reader an intimate glimpse of that era in rural life, as well as bringing home what it's like to endure racial discrimination.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
BOOKS_2_5	negative	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
BOOKS_10_8	negative	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
DVDS_38_41	negative	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
DVDS_34_5	negative	While documentary filmmaker Blitz is said to have based this alleged comedy on his own childhood battle with stuttering, you could have fooled me in this highly mean-spirited, ugly and too-proud-of-itself attitude that I immediately disliked it from the get go and the cutesy touches (Hal's creepy friend's parents use musical therapy with a cello and piano recital of the Violent Femmes' ""Blister in The Sun""), the fact NJ (my home state) is once again a one-note joke (and um, shot in BALTIMORE!!!), and namely no likable characters (nope even Hal becomes a real jerk in the long run).
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
BOOKS_12_28	negative	Actually the phrase â€œPersonal Legendâ€? was used 55 times in this book of 208 pages.
DVDS_54_9	positive	Although when the two characters finally come together after many bloody, graphic sequences, it is somewhat anti-climatic but the theme of doing the right thing at the right time nearly defeats what has transpired in the first half of this revisionist Western, the best since ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""The Proposition"".
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
DVDS_30_0	negative	BOOGEYMAN (2005) 0* Barry Watson, Emily Deschanel, Skye McCole Bartusiak, Lucy Lawless, Tory Mussett, Robyn Malcolm, Charles Mesure. Vapid, convoluted non-sensical mess of alleged 'horror' film about a young man (vanilla Watson) making a reluctant homecoming to face his fears in the form of the urban legend of the closet monster that may (or may not; frankly who cares??!!!)
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
DVDS_38_24	negative	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
DVDS_46_3	neutral	Sure there is a lot of funny jokes and scenes, but it isn't as original as I'd hoped.
MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
DVDS_36_28	negative	It would be best to get it on cheap rental day at the video store.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
ELECTRONICS_62_0	neutral	Pros: I loved the way it worked when it worked Cons: I am not a quiter; they will remember me for a long time; Can't count on the warranty; they were no help when i contacted them; i still have 1 month on my warranty; I am going to keep trying untill xmas Lexmark You can't trust them!
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
