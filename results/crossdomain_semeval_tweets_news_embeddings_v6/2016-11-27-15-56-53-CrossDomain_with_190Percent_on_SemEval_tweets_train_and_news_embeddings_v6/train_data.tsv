322	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,

The Americans are heading towards a huge failure, as the Taliban are coming back stronger with the support of Al Qaeda,
721	negative	The second explanation for the bank being comfortable is because the Finance Ministry has pretty much mopped up all that the banks offered in January and February. On the one hand, the ministry needed to pay out its outstanding debt to business operators, the now famous 2 billion euros, and then it needed to offset the almost 7?percent deficit in the revenue projected and revenue collected,

744	neutral	The Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II were trailblazers and true patriots,

1450	positive	I want my first win as team principal and my first world championship more than I realised. And I certainly don't want to be the man who fails to deliver the championship for Lewis Hamilton.
576	negative	Víctor Hugo Cárdenas should ask himself what harm he might have caused his neighbors for them to condemn him.

1209	neutral	Mrs Hani is a victim. The loss of her husband [due to Derby-Lewis' actions] has made her a victim. By participating, there is some comfort to the victim.

1325	positive	Labor must rehabilitate itself in the opposition as Likud did under Netanyahu,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,

464	negative	Terrorist activities of the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and other extremists are constantly mounting and undermining the basics of the Afghan statehood and impeding stabilization and restoration.

121	negative	If this is indeed the basis of Zuma's representations, this actually aggravates the case against him,
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
1394	neutral	While not shying away from the serious differences of opinion that remain between NATO and Russia, in particular about Georgia, we also acknowledge that we have obvious common interests with Russia: Afghanistan is one, but counterterrorism and the fight against WMD proliferation are others,

329	neutral	Perez Roque's style has always been much more conformational, maybe bombastic, then Raul's,

1303	negative	I do not have any medals thanks to Tudjman. The knowledge of he who calls upon me is questionable, and should know that he needs to protect the law.

1088	neutral	clear through the words of Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouallem on the matter.
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.
1483	positive	In the context of what we're doing, Secretary Geithner was notified, he has said, last week. As he reported to the rest of us, he moved aggressively and immediately, aggressively and immediately, to recoup whatever could be legally recouped. He recognized that you can't just abrogate contracts willy-nilly, but he moved to do what could be done.
240	negative	We have a video footage showing how GERB activists are giving out food products to voters, and a mass fight which breaks out after there are not enough products for everyone.

1350	neutral	My name is Peter Moore, I have been held here for nearly eight months now.
970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008. I urge the Government to focus on this opportunity to provide quick aid to

1047	negative	In my opinion, the PSD will not be the one to lose the elections but Basescu. And I am convinced that this is going to be the last mandate of Traian Basescu, as President. I think he is not entitled to run for elections any longer, and, if he does, my opinion is that Romanians who will still cast their votes for Traian Basescu are masochists

907	neutral	Fox News Sunday,
197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension.

1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area.

MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
DVDS_36_20	negative	A body and a voice do not an actor make.
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
DVDS_32_0	negative	SLOW BURN (2007) * Ray Liotta, LL Cool J, Mekhi Phifer, Jolene Blalock, Guy Torry, Taye Diggs, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Bruce McGill. More like a simmering potboiler: 1995's crackling neo-noir sleeper ""The Usual Suspects"" was in a class by itself but lately there have been some numerous copycats in attempting to glean some magic from its infamous twisted ending revealing who its arch-criminal Keyser Soze really was.
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
BOOKS_28_1	positive	Luckily, it picked up in the end.
DVDS_35_3	negative	Yes, Swain was too old to play Lolita but why, why on earth do they have her acting like a 5-year-old.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
DVDS_53_14	neutral	There are distinct echoes of supernatural based 'bad seed' films like THE OMEN (dapper, sober-faced lad with a lethal feel about him; check) and ROSEMARY'S BABY (spooky Upper West Side digs and female protagonist's waif 'do; check) but the line stops there, thankfully, not falling into an easy out (it's The Devil's Child!)
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
BOOKS_18_0	positive	In this short but insightful novel, Daniel Quinn has created a brand new view of history of mankind.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
DVDS_36_18	negative	It's okay for a short film or small part in a film, but a whole feature?
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
BOOKS_12_30	positive	All of this being said, I appreciate the message of following your dreams in both writings.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
ELECTRONICS_63_3	negative	:) It doesn't fit into my son's and friend's ears as well - keeps falling out.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
DVDS_31_3	negative	There is no rhyme or reason to the film as it progresses and by the end it doesn't explain anything that has just transpired (or even attempts too!)
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
MUSIC_95_1	negative	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
BOOKS_21_5	positive	You will be glad you did!
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
ELECTRONICS_63_4	negative	And the sound quality - my God!
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
DVDS_48_5	negative	Then good 'ol Kevin escapes the hospital with great ease not to mention heading back to his house and several other places to prepare for his assault on the bad boys lair.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
BOOKS_9_5	negative	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
DVDS_56_8	neutral	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
DVDS_36_3	negative	Where was the writer?
DVDS_38_16	negative	Kathy doesn't need to be a ""pro"" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
DVDS_33_5	negative	Written and directed by Jay Lee, heir apparent to Ed Wood for the 21st Century anyone?
DVDS_34_0	negative	ROCKET SCIENCE (2007) * Reece Thompson, Anna Kendrick, Nicholas D'Agostino, Vincent Piazza, Margo Martidale, Aaron Yoo, Josh Kay, Steve Park, Lisbeth Bartlett, Denis O'Hare, Jonah Hill. (Dir: Jeffrey Blitz) Lame mix of ""ELECTION"" and ""RUSHMORE"" Why is it some of the indies heralded at such prestigious film fests like Sundance often come across as crass, self-involved, hateful pieces of turgid junk?
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
BOOKS_9_6	negative	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
ELECTRONICS_61_5	negative	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
ELECTRONICS_58_3	negative	Had to get within 10 feet of a 14db gain antenna to have a consistent useable signal.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
BOOKS_9_2	negative	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
DVDS_52_11	positive	Great interplay between Garner as 'one- of-the-guys' and the three dudes making a fine buffet to her nubile attractiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
BOOKS_4_5	negative	Are her publishers totally ignoring the ever increasing deploring reviews?
ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
DVDS_43_12	neutral	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its ""X-Files"" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
DVDS_52_13	positive	who effortlessly provides the sex with aplomb, and tastefully so.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
BOOKS_5_13	negative	However, once I realized that there is little meaningful text hidden between tons of useless babble, I started speed reading and found that it was enough to read just the title of each paragraph and a line or 2 in caps.
BOOKS_7_12	negative	Around the fourth time I saw this pattern I got disgusted.
DVDS_38_0	negative	Why did I buy this one?
DVDS_38_31	negative	It really felt to me like Kathy was in ""aerobics class"" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
ELECTRONICS_68_4	negative	The television itself would have sound, but the receiver had none.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_38_2	neutral	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
BOOKS_7_1	negative	Barbara Hambly is no doubt a good writer, but I think she would be better served writing romance novels.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
BOOKS_1_0	negative	The book is disproportionally focused on single and multilayer feedforward networks.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_58_9	negative	Considering Palmone's lack of customer support and English as a second language staff, I would not recommend the purchase of this PDA.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
ELECTRONICS_62_5	negative	I am very upset, but i am not a quitter but a surviver ! I am going to keep on trying, they will definitely remember my name before i am through.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
ELECTRONICS_72_8	negative	Now the bad news: It is true that Gateway's customer service is not helpful if there are problems.
BOOKS_4_2	negative	Its a shame to be forced to give this novel a one star rating.
BOOKS_19_0	positive	This cd was pretty relaxing.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
BOOKS_8_3	negative	The second set of batteries only lasted a week.
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
BOOKS_16_17	negative	This is a very one dimensional book.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
ELECTRONICS_67_4	negative	When I called their support 5, yes, 5 times to solve just upgrading the firmware, they told me first that the iso was fine, then to use a boot diskette, then to use the iso.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
DVDS_30_2	negative	Not one sequence to the next has a cohesive thought or relation to the other is just the beginning of this inept genre flick with some laughable 'creature' f/x to say the least.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
DVDS_50_3	positive	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
DVDS_40_6	neutral	Director Glen Morgan (who helmed ""Final Destination"") does a rather decent job with the bloodletting and heebie-jeebies, notably the use of eye imagery (the original had some trademark sequences of close-ups of the fevered maniac's eyeball peeping out of several holes) and the equally grisly come-uppances of the co-eds (who quite frankly are almost difficult to tell whose who since the majority are nubile brunettes; not necessarily a criticisms more than an annoying observation).
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
BOOKS_10_17	negative	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
DVDS_36_17	negative	Does he have only one tone to his voice?
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
ELECTRONICS_59_5	negative	Let me satisfy that curiosity for you - as the service stands - don't waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
ELECTRONICS_66_6	positive	Nothing will compare with this newer version on WinMobile 7 with a 1.5 processor and a 4.5 inch screen.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
BOOKS_10_12	negative	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
DVDS_36_32	negative	Just thinking of this film makes my stomach sour.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
BOOKS_10_10	negative	Also, the two ""main"" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
BOOKS_18_6	positive	Ishmael presents a remarkably different view of the history of mankind.
DVDS_39_6	neutral	Here their brood of misfits take on a creepy underscore reminiscent of the cult classic ""Freaks"" but Solondz does manage to give his real-life challengers moments of humanity that all are but evident in the decidedly ugliness of what transpires.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
DVDS_53_12	positive	The bantam actor walks with a dancer's grace, his retro do suggesting a hep cat who is happy with himself in the world, and sharp features blend nicely into his Brad, who feels his edge on things dwindle not unlike Farmiga's Abby, who has the difficult role of a somewhat unsympathetic character (ie a mom incapable of caring for her children to the point of insanity) but acts up a storm in her unorthodox turn.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
BOOKS_16_5	positive	Mark Haddon's first book puts him in the league with great authors of our time.
BOOKS_25_5	positive	Nothing but the best!!
ELECTRONICS_60_4	negative	I managed to network two Mac desktops, an iBook, a Windows laptop, an all-in-one printer/scanner and a PS2 without any problems, except setting up the Windows wireless, but even that connected to the Macs on the network.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
DVDS_41_11	negative	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
DVDS_44_2	negative	""Lola"" is the worse actress in probably...the universe.
VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
ELECTRONICS_71_7	negative	-The speaker phone is very quiet.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
ELECTRONICS_66_0	positive	I have owned it since Nov 2009. The HD2 is the best phone.
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
ELECTRONICS_60_6	negative	This Linksys just didn't want to play.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
BOOKS_16_16	neutral	The book links all questions rather beautifully but still fails to impress.
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
DVDS_38_5	negative	Save your money and don't.
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
ELECTRONICS_58_5	negative	No warranty on display.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
BOOKS_25_0	positive	This is one amazingbook about a man (Gary Paulsen) and his experiances with running the Iditarod dog race in Alaska. It goes through his nothing but humorous traing process, and then onto the grueling, tiring, painful race.
DVDS_48_7	positive	Notice that I gave the film 6 stars and thats because it was a masterpiece in so many ways.
ELECTRONICS_66_8	positive	No so with HTC (hd2, Hd3)
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
DVDS_36_0	negative	When you are sitting watching an action film and the only thing you can think of is, 'Well, at least a lot of stuntmen got work', there is something wrong with the film.
ELECTRONICS_64_8	negative	HP all-in-ones don't seem to have this problem.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
DVDS_36_14	negative	Water? Yes. Water. I guess no one wanted to do any research and look for compounds that don't dilute quickly and become ineffective in water.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
DVDS_51_9	neutral	The only flaw in the otherwise fine screenplay by Michael Genet and Rick Famuyiwa is you never get the full story on this larger than life character who has something of a kindred spirit with the late, great Richard Pryor yet the film manages to push on with his sadly limited life (Greene succumbed to cancer in the mid'80s).
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
BOOKS_10_16	negative	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
BOOKS_15_0	positive	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
BOOKS_27_5	negative	I recommend reading the Gospel in Syriac for further excercise.
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
BOOKS_3_10	positive	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
BOOKS_26_2	positive	Building on known technics he refined and combined them to form a coherent framework that guides you from the first assessment to the final delivery, putting emphasis on the 'get it right the first time' principle.
BOOKS_10_6	negative	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
ELECTRONICS_63_5	negative	People I've been talking to were always complaining about low volume (they had it maxed on their receivers) and strange rustling and swishing noise.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
DVDS_30_4	negative	Producer Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for torturing us with this crap.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
ELECTRONICS_60_3	positive	The problem is this router doesn't really support Apple Macs. My previous router/modems (Speedtouch and Netgear wired) were literally plug and play.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
DVDS_38_44	negative	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to ""make a video"" on it, but has no experience at all.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
BOOKS_13_5	neutral	I did like the book, just not as much as Eragon and Eldest. Paolini seemed to not have an ending in mind and the closer I got to the end of the book, the more obvious it was that there was going to have to be a fourth one.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
BOOKS_5_11	negative	He takes examples of Homer and Hamlet but all that Mortimer does is to add lots and lots of padding and useless words to drive his point across.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
DVDS_41_9	negative	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
DVDS_29_0	negative	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to ""BRUCE ALMIGHTY"" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
DVDS_36_21	negative	Do you know who Jeff Chandler is?
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
DVDS_44_3	neutral	The action scenes were cool, the story was alright, but all in all i was not impressed.
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
BOOKS_4_3	negative	I think Patricia is simply milking the system on her way to retirement.
DVDS_49_5	positive	I particularly liked a very early sequence with Rose retreating to the cramped confines of a pale yellow tree house , an envisionment of a metaphorical giantess trapped by her environs (Jack even notices and simply declares ""you're getting to big for me""), attempting to adapt the her Brobdignagian largesse.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
ELECTRONICS_64_1	positive	Good print quality, speed, etc. for the price.
ELECTRONICS_68_3	negative	When the station would change from commercials to shows or vise versa, the sound would cut out on some.
BOOKS_23_2	positive	On the surface an unlikely romance, the story draws strong parallels to the coexisting US Civil Rights Movement: The Heroine: To all those Blacks who suffered abuse at the hands of others and developed strength to live through it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
DVDS_55_8	positive	Director Jacobs (who helmed the ""NINE QUEENS"" remake ""CRIMINAL"" for his long-time associates Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney's Section Eight production company (the high powered filmmakers serve as exec producers here) does a very good job of creating enough tension, sprinkled with dry humor mixed with dread employing tight editing by Lee Percy and a cool-to-the-touch cinematography by Dan Laustsen.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
BOOKS_3_6	negative	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
ELECTRONICS_64_3	negative	When ANY of the four ink cartridges are empty, all functions are disabled.
DVDS_176_3	negative	I was extremely disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
BOOKS_5_17	negative	But if you are looking for speed reading book, this is not the one.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
DVDS_50_7	positive	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
ELECTRONICS_65_6	negative	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_58_6	negative	Neither PalmOne or the merchant will warranty the display.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
BOOKS_9_1	neutral	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
DVDS_46_5	neutral	Anyhow, Ali G is like a cult character already, and I only wish there will be more Ali G movies, I know Sacha Baron Cohen can do MUCH better than this...
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
DVDS_46_4	negative	Somehow it seems to be aimed at US audience, there just was too much jokes that was heard and seen before.
DVDS_43_14	negative	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.
ELECTRONICS_64_9	negative	Buy one of them instead.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
ELECTRONICS_65_2	negative	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
ELECTRONICS_69_1	neutral	Love the tablet but when I installed it on my 10.5.5 iMac it disabled the functionality of my dual monitor even when using just the mouse.
ELECTRONICS_71_1	negative	Cons: Horrible quality.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
DVDS_35_7	negative	With all that said neither film lives up to the book but the Kubrick version gets away with more because he doesn't try to stay true to the novel, which is a masterpiece.
DVDS_52_10	positive	Written and directed by Susannah Grant (who makes her directorial debut here) does an able job overall with the usual formulaic expectations: overheard conversations misleading the truth; real-love triumphing; friendship & relationships put to the tests, etc. etc. But the cast makes it a winning diversion and a lot of fun.
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
DVDS_56_3	positive	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
DVDS_33_4	negative	So a demerit there!)
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
DVDS_32_5	negative	The whole lousy mess is indecipherable until it's cribbing of the final act of ""Suspects"" for its own conclusion that not only cheats a smart, knowing audience but feels like a cheat from the minute one character is onto another with a fateful 'wait=a-second' glance and pause in his tracks.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
BOOKS_8_1	negative	We had to replace the batteries after a weekend of play with the newly purchased book.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
DVDS_38_8	neutral	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.
DVDS_36_26	positive	If all spies looked like her and moved like her, there would be chaos in the world.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
DVDS_38_7	negative	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
ELECTRONICS_62_3	negative	so i went on-line to check on my warranty and that is all i could seem to do.
ELECTRONICS_72_2	positive	But for what I paid, the camera has worked pretty well.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
ELECTRONICS_58_8	negative	After haggling with both for several days only to finally find that it was going to cost $125, I was forced to have the credit card company charge-back the purchase.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
DVDS_52_14	negative	The only problem is how the pieces all fall into place relatively with little effort or dismay considering how her fiancÃ©e was killed and all and how they come to accept the flaky 'other woman' with barely a ruffle of feathers.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
BOOKS_21_4	positive	So pick up and read this book.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
BOOKS_24_6	negative	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
DVDS_29_4	negative	Sacrilegiously unfunny.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
DVDS_49_6	positive	While it is well acted across the board (Keener, again such a treat as a 'real' woman depicted on screen; warts and all) â€“ including a smallish role by the usual gregariously laid-back Jason Lee as a local greens man who keeps the uptake of the Slavin's demands - it is a showcase for the ethereal Belle (suggesting a love child of Chris Noth and Jennifer Connelly) whose dark quasi-exotic/girl-next-door/angelic being walks a thin tightrope of madness and a desire for 'normalcy' (she even deems Keener's Kathleen as just that 'regular'); she is a propagation of sorts.
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
DVDS_36_27	negative	Unfortunately, it is not worth the $9.00 to go see her only.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
DVDS_44_1	negative	Without them, i would have left in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
VIDEOGAMES_287_1	positive	Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
ELECTRONICS_60_9	negative	If you have Macs and need them networked over a cable broadband connection look for another Mac-friendly router or be prepared to get your hands dirty typing in IP and DNS addresses.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
DVDS_38_10	negative	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
BOOKS_25_4	positive	I reccomend this book to everyone and anyone, especially those who enjoy the great outdoors and animals.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_35_6	neutral	Griffith did an okay job but when I read the book I picture more of the Haze in the 1962 movie, meaning I see her as a bigger woman and more over the top.
DVDS_47_5	positive	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)
ELECTRONICS_71_0	neutral	Pros: Fair price, okay camera.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
ELECTRONICS_71_2	negative	Scratches way too easily.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
BOOKS_10_11	negative	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_64_4	negative	You are not allowed to use the scanner if any single cartridge is empty.
ELECTRONICS_59_3	negative	Most apply to the US (weather, sports news).
DVDS_29_1	negative	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
BOOKS_6_6	negative	Shame on the publishers!
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
BOOKS_16_22	negative	Readers get no insight into rest of the characters who could have very well defined the nature of relationship between Christopher and his parents.
BOOKS_11_3	positive	The cover was also very interesting.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
DVDS_33_2	negative	Tongue-thru-cheek T&A and dumb-as-a- stump zombie homage mashup of sub-Cormanian sleaze that frankly hasn't a clever thought in its ripped out skull: a futuristic US government run amok has an experiment gone awry resulting in a horde of zombies with ap*ss and vinegar Marine troop set in for the kill, only to unknowingly transmit the virus at a nearby strip-joint resulting in the titular monster- mish-mash.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
BOOKS_16_23	neutral	CONCLUSION: Well written and moving but not entertaining.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
DVDS_37_5	positive	The only entertainment I found was Norton's portrayal of a mental handicap.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
BOOKS_14_4	negative	I puzzled over the middle while he was lost at sea with the tiger.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
DVDS_54_6	positive	Proving it takes two-to-tango, Neeson is at his most subtle yet still a looming presence with his brawn and stalwartness bellies his real intent: revenge at any price.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
BOOKS_2_4	negative	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
ELECTRONICS_63_7	negative	If I could, I would like to return it or exchange for something better.
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
BOOKS_11_4	positive	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
BOOKS_26_1	positive	So he undertook the work and succeeded.
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
DVDS_37_3	negative	I endured the boring pre-heist moments, expecting a good final scene.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
BOOKS_7_13	negative	What's the matter Barbara?
ELECTRONICS_70_1	negative	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
BOOKS_18_9	neutral	So why the 3 stars?
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
BOOKS_1_1	negative	And though the book puts great emphasis on mathematics and even includes a big section on important mathematical background knowledge, it contains to many errors in the mathematical formulas, so they are of little use.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
BOOKS_17_1	negative	Set amidst US presidential race, terrorist attacks in the middle east and 3 insignificant judges in a federal prison, the book spins a tale of political showdowns and prison scams that get intertwined in the most improbable but highly predictable way.
MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
BOOKS_3_13	negative	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
BOOKS_7_15	negative	This was a very cheap substitute.
DVDS_48_1	neutral	This film is good in so many ways: Acting, cinematography, and raw realism ...BUT... It loses its' base and frustrates the movie-goer when it lacks reasonable logic and believability in several scenes.
ELECTRONICS_68_6	negative	It has a much more modern look and is much more user friendly.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
BOOKS_26_3	positive	In contrast with other books on human machine interaction the ideas of the book are coherent, logical and refreshing to read.
DVDS_41_15	neutral	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
ELECTRONICS_58_2	negative	... Weaknesses:Very poor wi-fi range.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
ELECTRONICS_67_12	negative	Is this the way 3ware builds their business?
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
BOOKS_7_23	negative	Yuck!
ELECTRONICS_70_5	neutral	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
ELECTRONICS_71_14	negative	This phone is reasonably priced, but the quality is terrible.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
BOOKS_16_18	negative	The story didn't seem to be very original.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
BOOKS_18_8	positive	According to Ishmael life is not about winning or ruling the earth, it is to live and let live and this simple message is delivered in the book through some very logical anecdotes and analogies.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
BOOKS_19_5	positive	It made me fall asleep the first night after using it.
ELECTRONICS_59_6	negative	You've been warned.
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
DVDS_36_11	negative	Unfortunately, all of these were involved in this film.
DVDS_55_7	positive	A surprisingly well-written screenplay by Steven Katz (SHADOW OF A VAMPIRE) and newbie Joe Gangemi, the dialogue rings true of the formulaic supernatural yet offers an intriguing premise interpolating Nietzchian thought (eternal recurrence) â€“ the two were students in a philosophy class â€“ and some fine moments of paranoia fueled anxiety for Blunt's heroine (is she in danger with this person or not), and although the 'ghost story' section feels a little rushed it works with the backdrop of the winter storm encroaching.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
ELECTRONICS_67_14	negative	I won't be purchasing from 3ware again.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
DVDS_41_10	negative	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
BOOKS_9_7	negative	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
DVDS_38_20	negative	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
DVDS_44_10	negative	It has some special effects, but you will not leave the theatre with a good feeling, just a wanting for your money back!
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
BOOKS_4_6	negative	I truly believe that the end is near for Patricia.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
BOOKS_17_2	neutral	The narrative is very realistic, and just when it seems that the story is reaching its climax, it ends!
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
DVDS_56_10	positive	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
BOOKS_7_7	negative	Well first of all she came up with the very original idea of an Imperial Super Weapon. Second, you know how many authors describe the difficulty of creating adversaries to give a worthwhile challenge for a very powerful hero?
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
DVDS_53_15	positive	but more like a really decent ""TWILIGHT ZONE"" episode.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
BOOKS_10_4	negative	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on ""how-to"" write an urban-fantasy novel.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
