242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
76_ 6	neutral	Once your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
129_ 5	negative	It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
132_ 311	neutral	 I mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
101_ 5	negative	Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
189_ 7	neutral	(iTunes being an exception of course).
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
39_ 3	neutral	Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
59_ 0	neutral	WRONG!
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
93_ 9	positive	I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
132_ 60	neutral	It is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
241_ 9	negative	The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
193_ 26	positive	For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
0_ 41	neutral	You don't have a shutter or aperture priority mode...so the lack of a high speed program is a total dealbreaker for me.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
241_ 14	positive	6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
189_ 15	negative	Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
225_ 58	negative	The flaw is inside the Zen.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
94_ 3	positive	A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
79_ 8	positive	With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
191_ 14	neutral	I managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
0_ 190	negative	Some adjustments in the settings could help make it better.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
91_ 11	positive	Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
195_ 42	neutral	Tested with the same mp3 for benchmarking
194_ 11	positive	The battery has a long life.
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
191_ 9	positive	What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
154_ 9	positive	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
254_ 6	positive	Best phone i've ever owned, period.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
311_ 2	neutral	I lost all my personal info.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
132_ 23	negative	 There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
224_ 11	negative	It's too bad, though, that !
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
3_ 2	neutral	I take it with me everywhere,literally,
59_ 1	negative	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
178_ 6	neutral	Quite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
279_ 3	positive	Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
232_ 0	neutral	I got this with the need for a nokia GSM camera-phone with speakerphone.
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
287_ 19	negative	Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
106_ 17	neutral	Bottom line: Highly recommended, but best when used in a table.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
225_ 67	neutral	out the bulletin boards.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
136_ 8	neutral	Shutting off what they t!
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
132_ 164	negative	If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
132_ 473	neutral	The backlight helps out at night, but can be a drain on the battery.
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
91_ 15	neutral	My toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
225_ 51	neutral	Using right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.

72_ 0	positive	I love this product!

186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.

277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
5_ 0	neutral	I have had this little gem for four months now.
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
287_ 34	neutral	(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
132_ 211	neutral	 If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
322_ 6	neutral	So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
132_ 479	neutral	 Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
195_ 41	positive	FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
66_ 3	neutral	Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs

323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
242_ 45	negative	The second piece of advice - Be prepared to spend a lot of time w/ this phone.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
189_ 5	neutral	I'll talk more about that later.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
132_ 50	neutral	 Wow iPod.
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
214_ 19	neutral	Napster 2 Go also allows members to view other members play lists in different genres, so if you are looking for lots of songs and you don't want to search for them endless, you can just grab them from other members play lists. !
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
209_ 3	neutral	Now, there's nothing wrong with the Zen Micro a few months in beta testing wouldn't iron out.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
267_ 3	positive	3. Play Java games on it.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
132_ 520	neutral	Product Of The Decade
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
276_ 1	positive	It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
176_ 1	positive	I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
209_ 1	neutral	Doing what, you ask?
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
213_ 22	neutral	Simply removing the battery and then replacing it fixes the issue, but it's annoying.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
132_ 149	neutral	then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
132_ 330	neutral	 You can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
80_ 3	positive	No need for deodorizers.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
44_ 1	neutral	Thank you Santa!
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
265_ 7	positive	The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
0_ 3	positive	The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in image quality.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
211_ 20	positive	The accesories that come with the player are great.
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
139_ 22	neutral	All wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
205_ 13	positive	Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
151_ 7	neutral	Granted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
217_ 26	neutral	Just because Amazon doesn't have it to sell doesn't mean the product is unavailable for review.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
193_ 53	neutral	Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
47_ 0	neutral	I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
132_ 35	negative	 There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
242_ 32	positive	The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
132_ 289	positive	The included earphones are pretty good - my advice?
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
193_ 22	neutral	Actually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
132_ 469	neutral	Match them pretty well to boot.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
189_ 9	neutral	I like to keep all of my Mp3s in one folder and manually doing this is a pain.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
225_ 29	neutral	A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
91_ 10	positive	The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
45_ 1	neutral	With the camera I also bought a 128MB compact flash card, an extra battery, and a carrying case.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
311_ 4	negative	I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
242_ 25	positive	Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
307_ 12	negative	Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
233_ 36	negative	Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
262_ 0	neutral	I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
235_ 1	negative	My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
15_ 2	neutral	Here are some useful facts:-
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
237_ 2	neutral	Ha!
211_ 13	neutral	It's doesn't have a scroll wheel, but it has a strip!
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
208_ 4	positive	The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
217_ 18	neutral	What device would I recommend?
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
298_ 11	neutral	We were so fed up that we uninstalled ALL of Norton Internet/AV 2004 and were going to try McAffee, but a techie friend recommended trying Norton SystemWorks 2005 first.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
184_ 6	positive	Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
264_ 0	positive	The phone itself is pretty nice.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
142_ 14	neutral	Check it out.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
79_ 20	neutral	I cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
201_ 3	neutral	I've played around with a friend's iPod a couple times and it IS a cool unit.
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
15_ 15	neutral	The front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
287_ 11	negative	The biggest problem is the installation.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
89_ 15	positive	SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
215_ 0	neutral	I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
242_ 5	neutral	If you've never used an advanced mobile phone before, you might assume this is par for the course, but it simply isn't.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
183_ 18	negative	) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord?
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
174_ 5	neutral	Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
225_ 39	neutral	I've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
242_ 6	negative	Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
132_ 451	neutral	 held out for the 4th generation 20GB iPod when I heard that it was coming equiped with the 'click wheel', that had previously only been available for the iPod 'mini'.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
193_ 17	neutral	It was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
225_ 20	positive	The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
190_ 21	neutral	Hands down, better quality than ipod's.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
