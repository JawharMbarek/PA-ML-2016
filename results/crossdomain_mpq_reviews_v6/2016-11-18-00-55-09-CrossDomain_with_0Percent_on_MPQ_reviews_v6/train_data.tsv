484	neutral	The De Larosiere group's proposals represent an essential step forward. They are ambitious but practical. The spotlight is now on the European Commission.

142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
35	negative	No one will believe this synthetic outrage. This all happened on Gordon Brown's watch as a result of his policies. That makes him part of the problem, not the solution.

570	neutral	I am happy to announce the alliance. We would campaign together for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections,
48	negative	We have long argued that banks should be required to put aside capital in the good times to deal with the bad. 'It is a shame the regulatory system created by Gordon Brown failed to ensure this, so the banks failed to fix the roof when the sun was shining.
287	positive	I think it's right to say that in Europe there is a real ... sense of new American leadership on these issues of climate change shown by President Obama and a very welcome sense of movement forward.

358	neutral	By going after big symbols like Coca-Cola, he is sending a message he will take on anyone,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
17	positive	I accept with pleasure the invitation from my friend Berlusconi... now that a spirit of friendship and cooperation prevails,

1303	negative	I do not have any medals thanks to Tudjman. The knowledge of he who calls upon me is questionable, and should know that he needs to protect the law.

246	neutral	I am aware that I don't stand a real chance to win a seat in the European Parliament, especially since the law gives me until April 7 to collect 100,000 signatures, which is next to impossible. There's a chance I won't even collect all these signatures, but I'll try,
