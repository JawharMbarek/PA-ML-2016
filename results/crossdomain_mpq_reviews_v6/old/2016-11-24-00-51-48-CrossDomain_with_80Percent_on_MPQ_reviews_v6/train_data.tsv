Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,

1002	neutral	This is a one-time dip into the National Insurance Medical Branch Fund,
123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue.

996	neutral	If we really want consumers to buy green, the sustainable choice must be an easy choice. Product information must be clear, and sustainable products must not be a luxury option.
