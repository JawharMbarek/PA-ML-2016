149	positive	For them (Third Front) being secular and communal is like changing clothes. A secular government without Sonia Gandhi is next to impossible. And this should not be considered as a sycophancy, it is a harsh fact in the country's politics,
1500	positive	United together, we can and will make a difference. I am pleased to offer my support of Earth Hour and am encouraged by the World Wildlife Fund's sustainability initiatives.

43	positive	I don't say there is any lack of personal chemistry between Gordon Brown and Obama. I think they have very, very similar views of the application of principles of Keynesism to combat recession. They are absolutely as one, but beyond that it will have to evolve over the next year or so... I know as far as Gordon is concerned he does regard this G20 meeting in early April as unbelievably important to try and resuscitate the ailing world economy.
