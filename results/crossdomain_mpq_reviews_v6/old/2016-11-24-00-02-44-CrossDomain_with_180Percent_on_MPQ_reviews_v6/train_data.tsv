1483	positive	In the context of what we're doing, Secretary Geithner was notified, he has said, last week. As he reported to the rest of us, he moved aggressively and immediately, aggressively and immediately, to recoup whatever could be legally recouped.

1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders.

Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,

1245	neutral	We will continue to be surprised on the bearish side by the data that's coming out - this keeps the demand deterioration argument very much alive, and pushes the OPEC production cuts to the backburner, precluding OPEC from becoming a significant force in this market,

1365	neutral	Let me say that for the first time, the National Assembly approved about $1 billion for domestic gas production in the 2008 budget, while $1.5 billion was approved in this year's. At the National Petroleum Investment and Management Service (NAPIMS) corporate headquarters in Ikoyi, Lagos, the NNPC chief commended the agency for being on course in spite of the challenges facing the sector and urged the agency not to relent on its efforts because its activities affect the country's entire oil and gas industry.

612	neutral	We are still a weak country, under political and international pressure, and we had mistakes like the escape of Goran Hadzic, but the problem that the Hague has needs to be sought in the court itself, not in Belgrade
1130	positive	Our movement rejects any agreement until all political prisoners in the West Bank are getting released and until the security apparatuses stop chasing Hamas members in the West Bank,
1209	neutral	Mrs Hani is a victim. The loss of her husband [due to Derby-Lewis' actions] has made her a victim. By participating, there is some comfort to the victim.

761	negative	In many ways Applegarth is a bigger villain than Sir Fred Goodwin. This is an outrage.

345	neutral	There is no question that Wall Street is losing patience,

706	neutral	I invite all nations and organizations around this table and others to provide financial contributions to this trust fund so that we can sustain the Afghan National Army,
684	neutral	I totally refute these allegations.

749	neutral	I just said that the gas chambers were a detail of Second World War history, which is clear,
10	neutral	This is the PM who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto,

970	neutral	We can aid the business sector, and SMEs especially, by reducing red tape. The Romanian state collects over 200 taxes, many of which bring little income to the state, but imply higher expenses for the public administration and taxpayers. Also, Romania has committed itself, along with its European partners, to reducing by 20% administrative costs imposed on SMEs. We took part in this decision in the European Council of December 2008.

156	neutral	Can you believe I got a message from Michael Jackson?
1045	neutral	Not even in my sleep have I talked to someone thereof. The PD?L candidate is Traian Basescu. It is just that PD?L should not hinder Traian Basescu, to stay where he is right now, a support and a factor pulling him down
322	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,

785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,

295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

982	neutral	If it is suggested -- as I believe that it is -- that I was involved in any conversations, the ective of which was to manipulate the National Prosecuting Authority or use it as a tool to frustrate Zuma's ambition to occupy the highest office in the land by prosecuting him, I am confident that, if any authentic record of my conversations with whomsoever is produced, no evidence would be found that would implicate me in such a conspiracy,

123	negative	It is far from clear that the 45p tax rate will produce much revenue. It seemed like a politically-motivated tax rise when Alistair Darling announced it and it is disappointing to hear a Conservative willing to talk of tax rises when Britain's economy is already dangerously over-burdened with a complex and heavy burden of Labour taxation.
