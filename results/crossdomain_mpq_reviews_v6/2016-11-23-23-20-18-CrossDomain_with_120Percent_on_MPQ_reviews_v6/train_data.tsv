He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed
1555	negative	By separating the elections for Bulgarian Parliament from those for the European one with the motif that the voters will become confused, the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) insulted their electorate much, much more.

225	negative	Today's decision to issue an arrest warrant for Omar al-Bashir is a landmark step towards ending the impunity of war crimes suspects everywhere. It shows that no-one even a sitting head of state is above international law,
516	neutral	This is a stocktaking a year before the World Cup in South Africa,
1458	neutral	We know that FIFA will not change the dates for us, but we have plans for that too. We have plans that will help us deal with the hot weather in those two months.

468	negative	We welcome the recognition that the Al-Qaeda threat is emanating from Pakistan,
321	neutral	I think the chances of this strategy (announced by US President Barack Obama on Friday) working are far better than the purely military strategy of the past, (because) it has a socio-economic component, a political component, and it has a military and intelligence component,
440	neutral	I want to make sure that our family, as well as the staff and all the people who come to the White House and eat our food, get access to really fresh vegetables and fruits,
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.

162	negative	Secretary Clinton's remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government - segregating human rights issues into a dead-end ‘dialogue of the deaf,'
221	neutral	I don't have a comment. If they (Tsvangirai and the Ministers of Home Affairs) have spoken at that level I can't comment,
239	neutral	Sinn Féin has a responsibility to be consistent. The logic of this is that we support the police in the apprehension of those involved in last night's attack.
581	neutral	If these plans are carried out, we run the risk of looking like a Third World country,
1383	neutral	Today's failed gilt auction should be of real concern to everyone. 'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.

1032	neutral	We expect the ECB to cut interest rates by a further 50 basis points to 1 percent in April,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
507	neutral	It's vitally important that first and foremost not only do we qualify for the World Cup, but it's imperative that we qualify for the Asian Cup,

644	neutral	It is our privilege to welcome the Arabian Gulf Adventure team and play host to these magnificent vintage cars. 'I am sure vintage vehicle owners in the UAE, and there are thousands of them here, will relish the opportunity to get up close to some of the most rare cars that Rolls-Royce has rolled out since its inception when the first model emerged in 1904.

I have been in regular correspondence with Liverpool for some time and fully sympathise with the club's feelings as to the importance of respecting the date of 15 April for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough.

138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,

341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,
