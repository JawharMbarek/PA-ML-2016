222	neutral	Gagnon said. President José Eduardo dos Santos, in power for 30 years, had announced presidential elections for 2009. However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament. Uncertainty over whether presidential elections will take place in 2009 is not an excuse for letting the problems highlighted by last year's elections go unremedied ,

610	neutral	I have been hearing from the European Union that the priority is diversification...of routes, supplies, sources. But the declaration...would only enhance the dominant role of Ukraine as a transit country.
75	negative	The market was hyped up on hopes that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would dazzle us with a stimulating stimulus plan,

Earth Hour heightens awareness and brings hope to the preservation of our shared planet's precious environment today and for generations to come,

827	neutral	The United States wants the Islamic Republic of Iran to take its rightful place in the community of nations. You have that right -- but it comes with real responsibilities,
681	positive	The main reason is to put some make-up on his face, to be able to present a kind of pragmatic, if you like, moderate coalition. The Labor Party is perceived as the party that started the peace process, the Oslo process. Once they are on board it is much easier to convince the international community that this government is not a radical-right government,

261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,

171	neutral	Every day we receive various information about Ratko Mladic and once we gather enough information we will arrest him,
1225	negative	I am sorry for Mr Panday. Because I guess when you come of age something happens to your mind. The party membership is supposed to be sacrosanct and they must be aware and the party must reform itself to have one strong body to oppose the PNM, it's the only way,

'It is too early to say, but the risk is that at some point the Government will not be able to fund its huge debts, and that could push up interest rates for families and businesses at the worst possible time. 'The fact that the Government cannot sell its debt the day after the Bank of England Governor warned about too much borrowing vindicates the argument the Conservatives have made about the dangers of Labour's debt crisis.
1140	positive	We're very clear that to make progress we need to talk to Hamas, because they represent a big proportion of the Palestinian people,
44	negative	This is a stark illustration of the true cost of Labour's Age of Irresponsibility. Thanks to the failings of the banking regulatory framework that Gordon Brown put in place, we have spent more than twice as much on bailing out the banking system as the United States % and taxpayers are on the hook for billions of pounds as a result.

1316	positive	I'd love to do what Harry did out in Afghanistan,
295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

189	negative	As you may know, Israel had an election earlier this month. The party receiving the third largest number of seats is led by Avigdor Lieberman who has previously called for the execution of Arab members of Israel's parliament who met with Hamas and whose main campaign message called for Arab citizens of Israel to sign a loyalty oath to the Jewish state in order to prevent their citizenship from being revoked. Do you support or oppose these positions?
34	negative	We never wanted to take oath from Pervez Musharraf but we had to take that painful step on the demand of Zardari Sahab.
1241	positive	This is an extremely important measure to ensure sustainable management of fisheries resources. I am delighted that Norway's proposal received broad support, and that with Norwegian financial backing the FAO will now initiate a process which will lead to international guidelines in this area. It is a major problem that fish which could be used as food are discarded, and the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs has put a lot of effort to address this issue over the last year,
1568	neutral	Rtd Gen Zvinavashe was a committed member of our party Zanu-PF and also of the army. He was very loyal, a military strategist and a hero of excellence.

1519	neutral	I think that the case of our councilors is ripe to go even before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Before, I respected the principle that the state must not be sued, even when Miloševi? stole from us [Radicals] in Kosovo taking 50 mandates, but now the situation is different,
1281	negative	such a conspiracy will become counterproductive and boomerang on the Bahujan Samaj Party and its leader Mayawati.
340	positive	They are bailing out just about anybody that shows up and says they need cash. The public has grown weary of it and instead of throwing a banker to the wolves they have decided to throw Wagoner to the wolves,

384	neutral	Family history is very important to me, and I was brought up knowing the origins of my family. They were the real Zionists at the beginning of the 19th century. I am a Rivlin from my mother and father's side, as they are seventh-generation cousins. My father is a descendent of the Gaon and the mitnagdim [opponents of Hassidism], and my mother is a descendent of the cousin of the Gaon, who was considered to have betrayed the Gaon.
