326	neutral	They are reluctant to send more troops and put them in harms' way. However, there are signs they are willing to do those other non-combat missions. I think that is going to have to be the way forward for the Obama administration,
261	neutral	We also discussed what we could be doing in terms of international action, whether in terms of listing more entities and individuals in the UN Security Council list of terrorist organisations and their supporters; you know like we listed Jamaat-ud-Dawah last December... actually it is very important that Pakistan decides to stop using these elements as instruments of state policy abroad in Afghanistan or in India,
824	neutral	This has been a huge challenge. When I look back at how far we have come in such a short space of time, it really is very impressive. Here, Formula One has taken on the role of technology accelerator for series production cars of the future.

674	neutral	We could have been Governor of Canada living in Ottawa in the Government House,
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting.

However, in November 2008 he raised the possibility that a new constitution may lead to election of the president by parliament.

197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension. It is difficult to see how Gordon Brown can, on the one hand, claim he is cracking down on offshore tax havens, and at the same time keep as a Treasury minister someone who appears to be involved in them.
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends.

It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

1483	positive	In the context of what we're doing, Secretary Geithner was notified, he has said, last week. As he reported to the rest of us, he moved aggressively and immediately, aggressively and immediately, to recoup whatever could be legally recouped.

577	neutral	If you look at what Churchill said and wrote about the issues affecting our times, mass immigration, dangers of radical Islam, you would see that Churchill, were he alive today, would be thrown out of the Conservative Party for things he said and his political home would be with the British National Party.

336	neutral	Eastern Congo has been mired in conflict since Rwanda's genocide nearly 15 years ago spilled war across the border and Hutu militias sought refuge here. Nkunda contends he was defending the region's minority Tutsis against the Rwandan Hutus. In a rare move by former enemies, Congolese and Rwandan forces drove out about 600 of the Hutu militias fighters earlier this year and the Congolese army hoped to force out 400 more by the end of March, said Kudura Kasongo, the Congolese presidential spokesman.

204	negative	These revelations provide, at the very least, evidence that Peter Mandelson has been doing favours for friends. Again, his position as a Cabinet minister is compromised by his shadowy personal contacts. 'It is astonishing that Roland Rudd, who has enjoyed lavish hospitality with Oleg Deripaska at the same time as Peter Mandelson, was granted so many meetings with ministers over such a short period of time. 'We know Mr Rudd's firm represents BAA, so now we need to know how he came to be granted such favourab
