138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
224_ 30	neutral	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
183_ 4	neutral	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
166_ 0	positive	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
207_ 10	positive	you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
209_ 5	positive	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
213_ 22	negative	it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
258_ 12	neutral	i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason :
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
231_ 20	positive	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
290_ 22	neutral	features :
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
227_ 38	neutral	11 .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
221_ 14	neutral	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
246_ 9	neutral	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
200_ 22	neutral	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
238_ 1	neutral	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
203_ 5	negative	* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
186_ 8	neutral	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
173_ 60	neutral	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
230_ 1	neutral	pros :
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
200_ 34	positive	great price .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
138_ 6	neutral	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
270_ 2	positive	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
105_ 6	positive	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
289_ 15	neutral	please !
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
234_ 10	neutral	thats it .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
155_ 8	positive	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
229_ 2	positive	price !
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !

200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .

197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .

226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .

285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
280_ 0	neutral	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
113_ 3	negative	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .

227_ 41	neutral	1 .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .

227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .

155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .

307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .

238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).

197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
231_ 21	negative	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .

234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .

285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !

160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .

228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .

222_ 6	neutral	no difference .

127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .

263_ 2	positive	it takes great pictures .

162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .

170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .

207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
297_ 7	neutral	i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
224_ 22	neutral	many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
308_ 5	neutral	...
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
144_ 4	positive	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
246_ 4	neutral	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
191_ 8	neutral	here 's why :
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
173_ 19	neutral	details :
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :

248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
