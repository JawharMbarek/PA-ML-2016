2217862	positive	Hi everyone!  Happy my schedule allowed for this today #FBR 
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
297_ 0	positive	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
231_ 15	positive	interface - practically seamless .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
166_ 12	neutral	likes
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
254_ 8	neutral	my pda becames a digital album .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
154_ 10	neutral	flat out
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
212_ 3	neutral	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
127_ 8	positive	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .

226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
173_ 52	neutral	scroll bar :
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb

230_ 1	neutral	pros :
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
164_ 0	positive	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
244_ 4	neutral	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
209_ 4	positive	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
186_ 27	neutral	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
140_ 22	negative	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .

282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .

106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .

276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !

306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .

304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .

269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .

200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .

277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .

174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .

270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
110_ 9	positive	it is a very amazing product .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .

293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
182_ 3	neutral	- price : see above .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .

191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
116_ 6	negative	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 13	neutral	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
134_ 21	negative	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
182_ 0	positive	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .

193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
285_ 27	positive	- excellent sound quality
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .

173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
208_ 48	neutral	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .

212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .

274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
200_ 8	neutral	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .

251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
151_ 17	negative	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .

193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .

301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
274_ 13	negative	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
224_ 30	neutral	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
