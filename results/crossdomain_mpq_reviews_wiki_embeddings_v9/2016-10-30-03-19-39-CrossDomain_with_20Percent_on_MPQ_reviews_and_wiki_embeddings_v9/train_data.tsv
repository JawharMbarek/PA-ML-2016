758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule. These are complex, sophisticated warships and where problems arose in the early stages MOD gripped the issue, renegotiated contracts where required and got the programme on track - the first of these impressive destroyers, HMS Daring, sailed into Portsmouth, her future base port in January this year. I have been following this programme closel

When it came to NDA, people named three prime ministerial candidates - Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Manmohan Singh - whereas in case of NDA, people were very clear about Advani as the right prime ministerial candidate. So it gave a clear picture that people want a leader who not only is capable of handling his or her party affairs but is also the decision maker. We, thus, decided to come out with the theme,

36	neutral	It's time for Gordon Brown and his colleagues to break the spell Peter seems to have over the higher echelons of Government.
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.

812	neutral	by William A Fleckenstein that his policy of keeping rates too low for too long inflated the housing bubble. The collapse in the US subprime-mortgage market led to about $1.2 trillion in write-downs and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Given the decoupling of monetary policy from long-term mortgage rates, accelerating the path of monetary tightening that the Fed pursued in 2004-2005 could not have prevented the housing bubble,

619	negative	I am not given the floor in Moscow so why not use some of my resources and knowledge to challenge in another city where they still have the chance of a fair election?

121	negative	If this is indeed the basis of Zuma's representations, this actually aggravates the case against him,

287	positive	I think it's right to say that in Europe there is a real ... sense of new American leadership on these issues of climate change shown by President Obama and a very welcome sense of movement forward.
1322	negative	We submitted a bailout program only a week after the coalition was formed, and it's not the government's fault that the government's anti-crisis program has not been considered and supported by the Verkhovna Rada.
73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states.

1131	positive	Any upcoming government must be based to the results of the elections that authorizes Hamas to select the prime minister,
676	negative	This savaging by the Labour Party's own backbenchers is a vote of no confidence in the government's record.
142	neutral	Even a few years ago, it would have been unthinkable that [Martin McGuinness], with all his history, would stand alongside [Peter Robinson] and the chief constable [Sir Hugh Orde] and say that we would not tolerate this criminality, while still retaining his republican ectives. That gives us encouragement, or should, in the current circumstances.
657	neutral	We did arrest a lot of his (Khan's) colleagues. He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed
535	negative	The Dalai Lama's ever-changing stances are against the historical and religious traditions,
912	neutral	A good example is the investigation into the murder of Anna Politkovskaya.
138	negative	My main reason for this is that I cannot be part of a list of laureates that includes Simon Peres. He is the man who was behind all the Israeli atomic policy,
606	neutral	Let me say very clearly that the way the European Union will relate to an [Israeli] government that is not committed to a two-state solution will be very, very different,
1470	neutral	It is possible to assume that [Prime Minister Ehud] Olmert's emissaries in Cairo will return to Israel with a deal for Shalit's return,
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting. However, we believe the cuts made to date, coupled with falling non-OPEC output, could already be enough to offset weaker demand and result in observable inventory declines in the coming months,

1093	neutral	I wish that the year 1388 be the year of peace, happiness and prosperity for all Afghans. A large pole adorned with colourful flags was then hoisted-a key moment broadcast live on television during which some believe prayers can be answered and miracles happen. Many of the estimated 10,000 people who packed their shrine for the event told AFP they would pray for peace. Others like Ahmad Shah asked for good health or prosperity. I wished that my business would improve. I believe in Ali's miracles,

224	negative	The law is clear. President al Bashir must appear before the ICC to defend himself. If he refuses to do so, the Sudanese authorities must ensure that he is arrested and surrendered immediately to the ICC,
139	negative	Peres established the reactor in Dimona and developed Israel's nuclear weapons program... In the same way as Pakistan's [nuclear scientist] Dr. Khan, Peres was the man behind the proliferation of nuclear weapons in South Africa and other states.

720	neutral	We are concerned about the Transparency International report on corruption in Kenya. Graft continues to hold back development and progress,
198	negative	ITV have made some crucial tactical mistakes. They bought two big lots of football rights when the rates were still very high, which they now can't afford. That was Michael Grade's mistake: he nicked the FA Cup off the BBC and now he can't afford to pay for it. It's not the first time he's done that, either. It's also no use him saying,
445	neutral	I firmly believe that voting along with Communists and the Social Democrats against the government is such an argument in favour of the end of their party membership that no one can question,
