73	negative	But in a campaign, this is a heart-and-soul matter. You don't sign up unless you have absolute confidence in the leader. I had in Morris and I certainly do with Anna. But not with Latham.
297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
376	neutral	Human Rights Watch has been monitoring human rights in Cuba for nearly two decades and the dismal state of human rights has not improved,
397	positive	However, South Africa supported the decision of the African Union to defer the issuing of the warrant of arrest against President Al-Bashir by a year to give the peace processes in the Sudan a chance,
824	neutral	This has been a huge challenge. When I look back at how far we have come in such a short space of time, it really is very impressive. Here, Formula One has taken on the role of technology accelerator for series production cars of the future.

1161	neutral	There is a drop in rocket attacks and only one rocket from a small organization was fired in recent days.

Also, Hamas signed an agreement with the Islamic Jihad saying it would avoid such attacks in the near future,
1276	neutral	The oil market may react negatively to the lack of a new cut from OPEC at its recent meeting.

619	negative	I am not given the floor in Moscow so why not use some of my resources and knowledge to challenge in another city where they still have the chance of a fair election?

197	negative	Each day brings more revelations about Paul Myners' alleged involvement in offshore tax avoidance and his failure to stop Sir Fred Goodwin's pension.
