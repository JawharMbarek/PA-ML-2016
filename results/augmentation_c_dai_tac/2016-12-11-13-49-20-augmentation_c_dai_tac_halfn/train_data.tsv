DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
MUSIC_98_5	negative	Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.
ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
ELECTRONICS_79_1	positive	Looks good.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
