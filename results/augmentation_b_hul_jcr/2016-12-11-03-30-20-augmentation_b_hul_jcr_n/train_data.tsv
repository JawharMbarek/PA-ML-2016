697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.

Due to the decision of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the Mihaileanu case, the Romanian President is the only citizen that benefits of total immunity and cannot be sanctioned as no legal charges may be filed against him. The draft law is intended to confer the President the status of a Romanian citizen, who has equal rights to all the others. I want to offer B

1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other. The PPP set an example when it made human rights the basis of Pakistan's 1973 Constitution, which remains the sole guarantor of fundamental freedoms and rights enjoyed by the Pakistani people.

488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.

119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
308_ 5	neutral	...
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
