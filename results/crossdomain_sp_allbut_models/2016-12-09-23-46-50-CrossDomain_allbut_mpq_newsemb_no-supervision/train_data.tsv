138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
285_ 24	positive	- solid , high-quality construction
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
131_ 4	neutral	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
206_ 7	neutral	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
123_ 26	neutral	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
270_ 7	positive	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
224_ 30	neutral	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
183_ 4	neutral	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
177_ 11	neutral	it can get pretty lonely out there .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
166_ 0	positive	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
310_ 26	neutral	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
207_ 10	positive	you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
209_ 5	positive	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
155_ 3	neutral	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is "" trendy "" to have that player .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
213_ 22	negative	it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why .
193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
258_ 12	neutral	i set the camera to the "" manual "" mode for one main reason :
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
285_ 2	neutral	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
231_ 20	positive	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
290_ 22	neutral	features :
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
227_ 38	neutral	11 .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
128_ 6	neutral	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
221_ 14	neutral	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
274_ 18	negative	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
246_ 9	neutral	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
109_ 1	positive	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
288_ 2	positive	and really this is the best phone one could have .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
200_ 22	neutral	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
176_ 0	neutral	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
303_ 3	neutral	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
310_ 12	neutral	no more annoying series of beeps .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
129_ 12	neutral	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
238_ 1	neutral	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
203_ 5	negative	* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
200_ 29	positive	extremely convenient .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
299_ 2	neutral	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
224_ 21	neutral	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
186_ 34	neutral	this is not a player you can take jogging .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 36	neutral	"" when will my t-zones work ? "" , csr :
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
186_ 8	neutral	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
236_ 13	neutral	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
173_ 60	neutral	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
230_ 1	neutral	pros :
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
164_ 12	neutral	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
224_ 16	neutral	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it "" unnecessary "" and "" so 20th century "" .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
200_ 34	positive	great price .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
138_ 6	neutral	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
193_ 3	positive	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
270_ 2	positive	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
105_ 6	positive	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
289_ 15	neutral	please !
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
289_ 8	positive	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
234_ 10	neutral	thats it .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
290_ 8	neutral	overall design :
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
155_ 8	positive	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
194_ 15	neutral	i 'll just say this .. .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
301_ 14	negative	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
236_ 18	negative	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
233_ 0	negative	do not buy this product --
229_ 2	positive	price !
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
302_ 8	positive	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
195_ 27	neutral	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
273_ 7	positive	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
136_ 21	neutral	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
282_ 18	neutral	sold in other parts of the world :
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
173_ 43	neutral	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !

200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .

197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .

226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .

285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
298_ 2	neutral	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
280_ 0	neutral	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .

247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
113_ 3	negative	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .

227_ 41	neutral	1 .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .

227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .

155_ 18	positive	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .

307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .

238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).

197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
231_ 21	negative	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .

234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
270_ 19	neutral	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .

285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !

160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .

228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .

222_ 6	neutral	no difference .

127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .

263_ 2	positive	it takes great pictures .

162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .

170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .

207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
274_ 5	negative	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
297_ 7	neutral	i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
208_ 44	neutral	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
129_ 14	neutral	trips .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
237_ 6	neutral	it did lock up on me a couple of times .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
154_ 0	positive	i love my new nomad , its great !
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
200_ 24	positive	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
224_ 22	neutral	many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
283_ 4	positive	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
308_ 5	neutral	...
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
306_ 13	neutral	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
197_ 2	neutral	software :
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
144_ 4	positive	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
246_ 4	neutral	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
227_ 30	positive	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
307_ 4	neutral	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
104_ 3	positive	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
191_ 8	neutral	here 's why :
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
173_ 19	neutral	details :
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
269_ 0	neutral	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
265_ 9	neutral	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
312_ 1	neutral	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
270_ 15	negative	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
305_ 6	neutral	now i can always be in contact .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
183_ 3	negative	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
243_ 13	negative	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
115_ 9	neutral	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
140_ 31	neutral	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
115_ 0	negative	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
277_ 15	neutral	so it was no loss .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
107_ 7	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
227_ 2	neutral	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
147_ 1	positive	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
299_ 3	neutral	you do take your chances with this phone .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
208_ 9	neutral	i do n't think so .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
191_ 12	neutral	3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
161_ 2	positive	way less expensive than the ipod .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
209_ 4	positive	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?
116_ 16	neutral	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
285_ 11	positive	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
151_ 5	neutral	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
215_ 21	positive	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
136_ 5	neutral	my story is based on personal usage .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
160_ 6	neutral	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
202_ 4	negative	it also has unproven battery life .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
236_ 11	neutral	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
186_ 12	neutral	this almost made it worth the price alone .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .

105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
217_ 6	neutral	cons :
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
164_ 0	positive	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
229_ 5	positive	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :

215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
300_ 21	positive	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
226_ 15	neutral	con :

193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
301_ 3	positive	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
115_ 21	positive	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .

234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .

310_ 18	neutral	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
225_ 12	neutral	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !

280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
123_ 30	neutral	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .

277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !

184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .

290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .

248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .

211_ 5	positive	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .

121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
200_ 28	neutral	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .

173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )

218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
186_ 60	negative	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
154_ 3	positive	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
309_ 2	neutral	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
127_ 0	neutral	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
246_ 1	positive	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
268_ 1	neutral	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
142_ 1	positive	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
226_ 11	positive	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .

313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .

119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
139_ 1	negative	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
247_ 5	positive	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
271_ 2	positive	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
218_ 11	neutral	i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .

134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .

214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .

295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
166_ 12	neutral	likes
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .

208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
282_ 31	neutral	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
184_ 2	positive	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
254_ 3	neutral	i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .

173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
278_ 1	positive	it is small .

166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .

195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .

207_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .

206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .

123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .

136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .

284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
157_ 7	neutral	sheesh ! !
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
140_ 6	positive	the moveable lcd screen is great .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
173_ 13	neutral	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
210_ 8	negative	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
183_ 7	positive	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
140_ 36	neutral	if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
170_ 21	negative	the interface used could be better designed .
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
310_ 21	neutral	their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
184_ 12	neutral	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
224_ 47	neutral	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
270_ 21	neutral	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
123_ 36	neutral	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
268_ 0	positive	seriously ! i love it !
310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
195_ 35	neutral	you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
170_ 28	neutral	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
285_ 5	neutral	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
169_ 0	neutral	i bought this only to have it break within a month .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
196_ 0	neutral	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
197_ 5	neutral	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
193_ 1	neutral	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
203_ 2	positive	* slick-looking design and improved interface
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
208_ 15	negative	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
140_ 11	neutral	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
173_ 27	neutral	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
221_ 2	neutral	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
123_ 8	negative	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
159_ 8	neutral	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
167_ 9	negative	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
173_ 15	neutral	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
215_ 55	neutral	my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music !
186_ 27	neutral	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
153_ 8	neutral	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ

He was under house arrest in Pakistan since 2004, but just a month ago, the Supreme Court of Pakistan let him out from house arrest and we have never been able to question this man and I think in terms of US interests in Pakistan and Afghanistan, it is critical that we question him and that we have assurances that the Pakistanis have him totally monitored so that whatever is left of this network is thoroughly destroyed

482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs.

297	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
1570	positive	The promotion of human rights in any society is, to a great extent, dependent on the commitment of its political forces and public representatives to fundamental entitlements of the citizens. For the Pakistan Peoples Party Government, politics and human rights are closely linked to each other.

615	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,

212_ 2	neutral	About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.
314_ 2	neutral	So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!
285_ 3	neutral	I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
68_ 0	positive	I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
265_ 6	positive	I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
92_ 3	negative	I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
242_ 49	positive	Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
193_ 49	positive	At 128 the songs sound very good.
214_ 20	positive	The sound is very nice.
209_ 5	neutral	Are you feeling lucky today?
36_ 13	positive	6- Small but very clear TFT screen.
11_ 2	positive	It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
253_ 1	positive	Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
285_ 0	positive	I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
140_ 0	neutral	I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.
225_ 1	neutral	I absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.
100_ 12	neutral	With them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.
234_ 3	negative	As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
213_ 25	neutral	I definately recommend upgrading the firmware, which is as simple as downloading a program from creatives website and running it with your player plugged in.
67_ 4	neutral	Diaper falls into bag inside the Champ.
62_ 2	neutral	I have no issues w/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.
183_ 35	neutral	Some other companies require you to send your player back and then charge you an additional $130 to replace their batteries.
65_ 4	positive	look at the size of it!
108_ 10	negative	The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
243_ 41	negative	Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
209_ 26	neutral	3.
183_ 42	neutral	6.
262_ 1	positive	Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
91_ 5	neutral	So then I used straight bleach.
221_ 3	neutral	Tall order, eh?
306_ 15	negative	They didn't know what the problem could be.
136_ 6	neutral	I'm glad I did.
69_ 0	neutral	It was a PAIN.
112_ 6	positive	I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
221_ 11	neutral	Apple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.
324_ 12	neutral	Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.
132_ 397	neutral	 When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.
163_ 0	neutral	This concept seems to be unusual.
323_ 2	neutral	Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).
28_ 1	neutral	One of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.
15_ 14	neutral	Tamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.
179_ 15	positive	The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard.
274_ 9	negative	2) Phone is awfully slow.
132_ 434	neutral	No more Cds and your cd player getting broken when you step on it in your car or any other place
270_ 11	positive	It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.
315_ 3	neutral	I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.
221_ 25	neutral	A bargain $200.
181_ 10	negative	Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.
204_ 4	positive	The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.
274_ 14	negative	There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
239_ 2	neutral	Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.
237_ 1	neutral	What is that, .00000001 megapixel quality?
169_ 0	neutral	I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.
65_ 0	neutral	We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.
176_ 7	positive	After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.
138_ 11	neutral	So then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.
100_ 18	neutral	It takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.
225_ 10	neutral	The sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.
267_ 0	positive	I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:
132_ 313	positive	  Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
157_ 2	positive	My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.
241_ 20	positive	Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
307_ 0	neutral	NIS is a package of several Norton products.
113_ 5	positive	The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
11_ 5	neutral	The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
165_ 0	neutral	Years ago I had an old Linksys router that I never could get to work right.
253_ 2	neutral	So, do I recommend the 6600?
84_ 0	positive	This is a great diaper pail.
0_ 217	neutral	that u missed in the mirror!
285_ 5	neutral	This is pretty standard for an up to date computer anymore, so what's the fuss?
0_ 125	neutral	Otherwise, I would have changed my one-liner to "useless" instead of "flimsy".
193_ 53	neutral	Creative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.
110_ 5	positive	I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
195_ 6	neutral	Havent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).
132_ 169	positive	 Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.
0_ 148	positive	I've only had this camera for a few days, but it's been great.
272_ 3	positive	This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
233_ 19	positive	The phone is sturdy.
132_ 136	positive	 As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.
223_ 14	positive	The extra Gb is just a bonus.
162_ 5	positive	The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server.
225_ 59	neutral	You can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.
0_ 137	neutral	So i figured i would "compromise" and get the camera that i could, and would, take everywhere.
274_ 6	negative	Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.
122_ 5	neutral	I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.
252_ 1	positive	I never had a single problem.
217_ 10	neutral	So tack on a scroll wheel and... you still have to compete against the intuitive OS-based application that an iPod offers the user.
206_ 22	neutral	I will be using the player 99% of the time as an MP3 device, so these small pauses are entirely bearable, for the added features just to be available.
11_ 6	positive	The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
137_ 9	neutral	But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.
195_ 33	negative	I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
215_ 1	neutral	They now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.
0_ 83	positive	digital zoom is clear too...say you used all 3x optical zoom, try to do digital zoom then...just try not to shake the camera at all and you'll still get a clear good quality picture
311_ 10	negative	No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
132_ 302	neutral	The game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.
132_ 71	negative	but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
112_ 1	neutral	The owner had three routers - all M12's.
146_ 9	positive	The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.
217_ 0	neutral	... then this might intrigue you greatly.
213_ 14	neutral	my initial reaction was to tap the up and down arrows, when in reality, you need to touch, maintain contact and slide your finger up and down.
221_ 17	neutral	)  Compatibility?
132_ 293	neutral	 But really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.
212_ 7	neutral	$190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).
46_ 0	neutral	I've got a couple of digital cameras.
170_ 12	positive	It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys.
166_ 53	neutral	What about the wireless capability, you ask.
313_ 7	negative	The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
39_ 6	neutral	While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.
117_ 3	positive	One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
132_ 517	neutral	  I am so impressed with the iPod that our next purchase will likely be a Mini Mac.
0_ 173	positive	The view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer.
194_ 9	neutral	The radio and voice recording are nice.
242_ 34	positive	As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
0_ 2	positive	A Digic II-powered image-processing system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip, its start-up time is tops in its class, and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition.
217_ 3	neutral	The latest craze for MP3 manufacturers is the 5Gb microdrive, a 25% boost from the 4Gb ones supplied by Hitachi.
132_ 380	neutral	 The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.
106_ 9	negative	With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
111_ 3	positive	Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
236_ 3	neutral	In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.
100_ 1	positive	This is really a nice diaper pail.
111_ 4	positive	UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
279_ 7	positive	I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
256_ 12	negative	Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
111_ 15	neutral	Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.
189_ 26	positive	Record memos using the built in microphone.
207_ 17	neutral	Y!
132_ 191	neutral	 Wow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!
214_ 15	neutral	There were two downloads I had to complete.
127_ 11	positive	I really liked the price...
273_ 2	negative	For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
0_ 1	positive	It has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we've ever tested.
136_ 25	neutral	What is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.
207_ 2	neutral	I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.
138_ 17	positive	I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.
193_ 13	neutral	The player was not very appealing either.
213_ 26	neutral	(linux geeks -> avoid the 2.x series that is aimed at windows media play!
143_ 3	positive	there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth.
136_ 14	neutral	No Wires !
253_ 7	negative	Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
133_ 0	positive	This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.
136_ 31	neutral	They do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.
233_ 32	positive	The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
229_ 12	positive	These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted.
100_ 24	positive	Works great!!!!
211_ 5	positive	It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.
242_ 36	positive	Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
31_ 14	negative	I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
225_ 23	neutral	This feature wo!
199_ 9	neutral	One reviewer made what *I thought* was a good point about the volume not having an independant control and being buried in a menu, but must not have spent very long with the player because if you slide your finger up or down the center touch button during a song, the volume goes up or down accordingly.
153_ 0	positive	Setup in XP was instant and intuitive.
225_ 22	positive	Track #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.
304_ 6	negative	Can't get easier than that!
196_ 10	positive	It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.
132_ 404	neutral	The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.
214_ 7	neutral	I have a lot of songs that I need to download.
287_ 38	negative	Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
207_ 15	neutral	I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.
185_ 8	neutral	I also think that if you are going to offer them in different colors then commit all the way and have the entire device in that color, not just the front and color the head phones as well.
270_ 13	positive	I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
274_ 15	negative	5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
283_ 2	negative	The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
223_ 1	neutral	That was before the Zen Micro came along.
138_ 21	negative	little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.
110_ 4	neutral	I have many others in the past.
308_ 0	neutral	I bought Norton Internet Security years ago when it first came out.
225_ 61	neutral	In other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.
138_ 18	positive	Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.
31_ 6	positive	The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
137_ 6	positive	Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.
320_ 4	neutral	In "Add/Remove, you must selecting the program's Change button.
107_ 7	neutral	The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.
194_ 15	positive	So far I have no complaints with this player.
248_ 3	negative	The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
195_ 4	positive	I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.
31_ 8	negative	All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
100_ 15	positive	3.  Bags are easy to change.
46_ 2	neutral	Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.
270_ 7	negative	My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.
264_ 5	neutral	Depending on the timing of the postmark date, you don't get your second bill until the postmark date passes, so it's impossible to qualify for the rebate.
225_ 40	neutral	It cost less than, in most cases, $190.
243_ 40	neutral	You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.
191_ 17	positive	- Replaceable battery.
183_ 4	neutral	Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!!
35_ 19	positive	The manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance (but there is no manual focus or manual exposure).
193_ 46	positive	I enjoy getting use to the touch pad.
132_ 192	neutral	 So dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...
304_ 8	negative	I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
132_ 497	neutral	 The iPod is a little more weighty than I expected, but it's not unmanageable.
31_ 2	neutral	I put a 128MB CF card in it.
32_ 2	neutral	I had been waiting for the prices of digital cameras to come down before  taking the plunge.
270_ 12	positive	It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.
123_ 0	negative	This router was a huge disapointment.
162_ 3	positive	Works pretty well.
106_ 12	neutral	The M12V is really set up for right hand operation.
245_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
183_ 30	negative	) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices.
123_ 5	positive	I did like the heft of the machine.
135_ 8	negative	Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac.
0_ 25	neutral	WOW! Big difference!
287_ 10	negative	They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
241_ 2	positive	What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
146_ 4	neutral	I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.
227_ 14	neutral	Subscription files need to buffer when you first hit "play," so there's a 4-7 second delay before the first song starts.
110_ 1	positive	I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
232_ 6	positive	Using supplied s/w, you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it.
34_ 2	neutral	What else can I say?
183_ 41	neutral	I have gone through two of them in two years. .
313_ 8	neutral	It's become tedious doing this.
270_ 15	positive	I never get dropped calls.
228_ 10	positive	Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.
89_ 19	positive	All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
126_ 1	positive	The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
132_ 320	neutral	However, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.
207_ 21	neutral	It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.
144_ 6	negative	After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).
135_ 23	neutral	If you have a Mac, I don't think you should totally discount this product.
190_ 14	negative	The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding.
126_ 2	positive	I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
132_ 102	negative	 Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
32_ 6	neutral	The included battery charger is larger!
136_ 32	positive	All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.
54_ 7	positive	The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
69_ 5	neutral	I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.
224_ 4	negative	So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.
250_ 1	neutral	A few things that I want to suggest for improvements:
0_ 186	positive	In low light with flash I found it clear better then the sony P200 (too much red, colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes).
132_ 439	positive	 They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
94_ 1	neutral	I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).
132_ 362	neutral	 Be sure you test this first to see if it does feel intuitive for you, rather than just going on the fact that it does sound pretty neat.
307_ 11	negative	Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
111_ 9	neutral	LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:
190_ 0	neutral	I'm addicted to music.
132_ 428	neutral	  Think about that if you are worried about battery life.
287_ 28	negative	The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
132_ 15	neutral	Yeah, pretty weak.
105_ 5	positive	So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
298_ 6	negative	Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
242_ 24	positive	First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
124_ 2	neutral	Unfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.
179_ 20	positive	the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.
265_ 4	negative	I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
55_ 0	neutral	In concept, it's a fabulous idea.
183_ 39	positive	The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great.
270_ 10	positive	It also works just fine for international calls.
317_ 0	neutral	While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
0_ 223	negative	I thought this camera was awful and I did tons of research on CNET and other sites.
206_ 5	neutral	You ask, yup.
264_ 3	neutral	But watch the Amazon rebates on these (T-Mobile rebate is fine).
174_ 14	neutral	MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.
232_ 5	positive	I have set up it's PDA features with avantgo.com where you can download info from sites like weather,mapquest maps/directions into it, which is great.
25_ 5	neutral	I'd suggest that you not only buy this camera, but the case for it and an extra battery pack.
171_ 0	neutral	I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.
107_ 6	positive	This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
279_ 2	positive	You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).
132_ 466	neutral	 I used it mainly on shuffle play and shut off the "click" sound to get this much life out of it.
132_ 54	neutral	iTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.
231_ 0	positive	I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
166_ 67	neutral	However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!
35_ 22	neutral	It's a little jewel.
103_ 4	negative	However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
106_ 15	positive	Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
242_ 0	negative	OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
137_ 0	negative	I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.
249_ 8	negative	I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
206_ 2	neutral	Of all the players that I have owned in the past (6 of them), all of them have had drawbacks and problems.
166_ 47	neutral	Why the four-port wireless model you ask?
324_ 10	neutral	On my own home computer.
66_ 0	negative	For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
209_ 22	neutral	unboxed and charging up, visit the Creative website for necessary firmware and/or driver upgrades, especially if you're planning to use a service like Napster.
0_ 71	positive	My SD500 focuses flawlessly, does not "whine" during video, and my pictures are razor sharp.
12_ 1	neutral	A 2X optical zoom (you can pretty much ignore any time a  manufacturer refers to "digital zoom")
234_ 10	neutral	Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.
132_ 472	negative	This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see.
79_ 24	neutral	The positives outway the negatives.
193_ 10	neutral	I also hated the packaging, with a passion.
134_ 7	neutral	They!
132_ 414	neutral	  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.
101_ 2	negative	The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
132_ 114	neutral	The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!
132_ 98	positive	 Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.
317_ 2	neutral	The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
193_ 24	positive	It was also the most appealing.
194_ 4	positive	It holds plenty of songs.
0_ 185	positive	When the overall image quality (especially natural colours, details, natural looking of the pictures) is the most important thing, then this camera ist top notch and very impressive.
15_ 3	neutral	On a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.
311_ 3	negative	Their site offers no live help at all.
316_ 0	neutral	I've had the last 3 versions of NIS.
16_ 3	negative	The price is $... more.
25_ 3	neutral	I especially like the way that ZoomBrowser EX lets you look at a virtual filmstrip of your pictures.
211_ 4	neutral	3It's been dropped, shuffled, kicked, and Lumbered.
134_ 3	negative	The Wizard is particularly sinister.
191_ 20	neutral	I find myself listening to the radio a lot.
281_ 9	negative	Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
189_ 3	neutral	However, since you're reading this review, you want to avoid getting an iPod.
76_ 5	neutral	I still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.
265_ 10	positive	As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
133_ 4	neutral	That only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.
319_ 3	neutral	My previous experience with multiple Symantec/Norton products has been good.
243_ 8	neutral	Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.
189_ 24	positive	 FM radio built in (Howard Stern).
298_ 9	neutral	It wasn't the computer - it was Norton Internet Security 2004 which is the culprit!!
211_ 18	neutral	But after a few firmware releases it's working without a hitch.
183_ 22	negative	I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged.
10_ 1	positive	I am very pleased with my purchase.
227_ 12	negative	The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.
206_ 17	neutral	Not everything in this world is 1!
298_ 15	neutral	We've only had it 2 days, but so far so good.  (WRONG - SEE UPDATE BELOW)
134_ 0	neutral	It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.
0_ 115	neutral	Buy it, you will love it.....
227_ 4	neutral	At the time of this writing, that firmware is a "beta release."
251_ 9	neutral	As soon as you copy video/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.
132_ 369	neutral	  This may be the player for you, but it's not leaps and bounds ahead of any other player, and others are ahead of it in certain areas, so practice some caution when you buy.
199_ 16	positive	After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.
147_ 6	neutral	Just no internet.
242_ 30	neutral	RECEPTION: This really depends on locale & carrier.
144_ 3	neutral	I use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.
243_ 27	neutral	Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May '03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!
312_ 4	negative	To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
151_ 4	neutral	I also had to do this with the old router.
227_ 11	neutral	Use Windows Media Player 10 to do your transferring.
320_ 9	positive	So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
268_ 27	negative	It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
0_ 121	neutral	However, it was not so in my case.
36_ 15	positive	Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.
0_ 215	neutral	Camera powers on and ready in about a second.
129_ 0	neutral	I have owned this router for nearly five years.
0_ 107	positive	All in all, this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price.
0_ 152	positive	As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image apeared on the decently sized screen.
0_ 187	neutral	The Fujifilm F10 is probably the best compact camera for low light (ISO 400 with not much noise, even ISO 800 is relative good).
201_ 17	neutral	Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it.
25_ 7	negative	I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
259_ 2	negative	I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
108_ 12	negative	The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
108_ 11	neutral	This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.
69_ 4	neutral	For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.
132_ 37	neutral	OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average.
166_ 8	neutral	Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.
132_ 203	neutral	 So it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.
197_ 4	neutral	In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.
67_ 7	neutral	A couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.
208_ 2	neutral	After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.
139_ 6	positive	I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.
31_ 5	positive	The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
223_ 0	neutral	I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.
132_ 198	neutral	However, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.
106_ 0	positive	Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
225_ 5	neutral	I wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.
189_ 17	neutral	Update the firmware which can be found on the Creative web site.
251_ 2	neutral	the difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....
49_ 4	positive	The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.
190_ 27	negative	My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
132_ 301	positive	Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.
298_ 17	neutral	If SystemWorks 2005 starts to act up, I'm done with Norton products forever.
110_ 10	positive	It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
280_ 5	negative	I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
234_ 9	negative	I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
204_ 6	positive	It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.
241_ 12	positive	5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
67_ 8	neutral	Bag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.
322_ 9	negative	And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
0_ 67	negative	I would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature.
270_ 1	positive	It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.
181_ 7	neutral	I just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.
135_ 5	neutral	I am a generally computer-savvy person; not an IT expert by any means (which is what router configuration sometimes seems to require), but I can install and manage most computer stuff without too much support.
0_ 166	neutral	I had G600(6MP) before this one and I noticed big difference in picture quality and performance using SD500.
251_ 8	negative	3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
275_ 14	negative	if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.
187_ 4	neutral	The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.
0_ 106	positive	If you on the other hand always use automatic settings (and not manual) you should be just fine, as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen.
312_ 8	positive	I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
294_ 3	negative	Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
286_ 1	negative	Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
79_ 17	neutral	The Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.
111_ 18	positive	Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
113_ 7	positive	I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
107_ 2	positive	The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
287_ 26	positive	These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
186_ 0	neutral	I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.
49_ 3	neutral	I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.
287_ 40	negative	Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
201_ 7	positive	When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY!
217_ 11	neutral	It's easy to find songs, organize songs, and also carry some essentials and diversions.
132_ 244	neutral	 Dunno, possibly but you have to ask yourself what you are neccessarily paying for, which is 20GBs worth of storage capacity, which even if all your music is in high fidelity such as 320kpbs, there is still a whole lot of room to place much music in here.
173_ 4	neutral	But everything worked out for the best.
0_ 196	positive	The manual is excellent.
62_ 0	negative	My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
150_ 5	neutral	For effort free wireless network adaptors, use the linksys USB adaptor.
241_ 3	neutral	The best features that I use most often are:
134_ 16	neutral	It just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.
214_ 28	neutral	However, I am going to try the suggestion of changing the sensitivity to high and see if that solves the problem.
35_ 5	positive	The metal housing seems very rugged.
196_ 3	neutral	Nevertheless, I still get shirked when someone out of ignorance states "But it's not an IPod!" or "Never heard of it, I'll go with the IPod".
81_ 3	negative	We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
99_ 7	positive	We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
132_ 325	neutral	One of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.
132_ 177	neutral	Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.
0_ 100	neutral	i forgot to mention about the camera's design.
233_ 21	positive	Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.
138_ 10	neutral	to which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.
132_ 255	neutral	 This review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.
89_ 10	neutral	For those who complain that the pail gets stuck, that is probably a good indication that the BAG IS GETTING TOO FULL!!
132_ 510	neutral	  Of course, once the songs are converted, you don't have to worry with them again.
205_ 12	negative	They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons.
207_ 24	negative	The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.
35_ 11	negative	The dynamic range seems not quite as good as the Kodak DC260.
195_ 13	neutral	I have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).
132_ 504	neutral	  I use mine mostly at the gym, so this is fantastic for me.
304_ 5	negative	If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
214_ 0	neutral	I have been researching MP3 players for the last two weeks.
234_ 7	negative	I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
35_ 10	neutral	You need to use the manual exposure adjustment in backlight or bright light conditions such as with snow in the background.
240_ 12	negative	But not good enough for me.
214_ 18	neutral	And within one hour I had downloaded , organized my play lists and was listening to the songs I downloaded.
193_ 38	positive	I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.
324_ 13	neutral	Finally I ran msconfig and went into the "services" tab and unchecked every last Norton/Symantec "service," then ran uninstall again.
69_ 2	neutral	it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.

246_ 3	neutral	Same with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.

280_ 3	positive	It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
17_ 4	positive	But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
0_ 5	neutral	I sincerely question the CNET reviewer's ability and/or their bias.

3_ 20	negative	The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
242_ 19	negative	It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.

243_ 2	neutral	It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.

186_ 5	neutral	All I can say is what a wonderful choice!
106_ 7	neutral	I've cut dadoes, flush trim to duplicate a complex form, and done roundovers and Roman ogees.
216_ 5	negative	Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.

132_ 229	neutral	I have wanted one for a long time, but just didn't want to spend the money.
168_ 4	neutral	When I gave up and called their help desk, they sent me to a web site, I ran a program and viola - I was on the net wirelessly.
201_ 14	neutral	I expected this coming from Creative.
198_ 0	positive	Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.
276_ 4	negative	DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.

82_ 2	neutral	It is also to wipe clean if you do get the chute a bit dirty.
263_ 11	neutral	If you own an apple you can isync it to your address book so that you have all of you numbers in two places..... in case you lose your phone (get INSURACE)
163_ 6	neutral	Someone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.
213_ 21	negative	It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working?
132_ 274	neutral	 The problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).
13_ 1	negative	I then realized a major design flaw.
263_ 13	negative	i would highly recommmend...... oh and i have owned this baby for like 6 months now
213_ 27	neutral	er compatibility, you can't downgrade the firmware.

306_ 17	negative	I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
195_ 22	neutral	I have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.
132_ 243	neutral	 Still my favorite MP3 player  Is it overpriced ?
214_ 25	negative	I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.
130_ 0	positive	This is a fantastic tool to use.
240_ 5	negative	And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
132_ 516	neutral	 This is the first line of Apple products I have owned (we also have an iPod mini and are about to purchase a shuffle).
201_ 13	positive	Moving on to sound department... It delivers!

144_ 0	positive	I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.
35_ 3	positive	Even with the waterproof housing it is small.
207_ 26	neutral	I threw it away.
132_ 344	neutral	    If you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.
306_ 3	neutral	There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.
132_ 205	neutral	 This has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.
250_ 4	neutral	So you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose "send touch tone" and find your contact from the address book.
16_ 1	negative	The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
136_ 29	neutral	The operating system is Windows XP.
58_ 9	positive	The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
71_ 0	neutral	My original purpose in buying the Diaper Champ instead of the Genie was to use it with cloth diapers.
278_ 6	positive	N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.
0_ 64	neutral	If you use the LCD wisely and dont use it as a TV screen to show all your buddys the girl you went on a date with last night, you should be able to get plenty of shots in on a charge, I have only seen the warning light once, and that was after a week of daily occasional to medium duty use.
240_ 11	positive	It's good.
212_ 12	positive	It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).
132_ 409	neutral	  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.
128_ 0	neutral	I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.
132_ 254	neutral	By far the best MP3 player I've ever used
132_ 357	neutral	THE CLICKWHEEL: Again, I realize that most people think this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
132_ 441	negative	Hard drive screws up occasionally
25_ 1	positive	This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
287_ 29	negative	Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
252_ 4	positive	3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
178_ 23	neutral	The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.
79_ 19	positive	The Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.
201_ 9	positive	The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus.
0_ 58	positive	Powerup is quick, and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on.
208_ 3	negative	It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.
132_ 436	positive	 Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
83_ 9	neutral	I am very pleased with our choice.
109_ 3	negative	I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
117_ 11	neutral	As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.
42_ 1	positive	After getting one for Christmas from Amazon, I'm now a believer:  The Digital Elph is truly the world's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures.
15_ 11	neutral	The closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).
225_ 53	negative	Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
132_ 432	neutral	I like it.
234_ 8	negative	It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
312_ 3	positive	Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
283_ 0	negative	Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
132_ 223	positive	This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
246_ 1	negative	It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
285_ 2	positive	Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
255_ 2	positive	It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.
287_ 35	neutral	Even this, however, did not solve my problems.
188_ 4	positive	The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.
222_ 4	positive	The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
117_ 10	neutral	I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.
2_ 0	positive	OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
290_ 4	neutral	If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.
136_ 17	neutral	Let's get a perspective here.
140_ 4	negative	I tried the CD setup program without any luck.
57_ 0	positive	There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
213_ 11	neutral	Also provides for playlists which are nice, but really only usefully set up through the PC software.
193_ 57	neutral	If you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.
132_ 519	neutral	You've earned a new fan.
138_ 22	positive	I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.
206_ 14	positive	Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
287_ 43	neutral	No longer.
136_ 9	neutral	ell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.
86_ 0	negative	I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
163_ 10	neutral	Maybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?
229_ 8	positive	sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!
137_ 8	negative	Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco.
173_ 9	positive	Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.
79_ 10	neutral	The Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.
32_ 1	neutral	I've owned a few 35mm cameras over the years, including one SLR and two point & shoots.
109_ 4	positive	Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
294_ 2	neutral	The former hogs memory and it takes ages for the computer to start.
68_ 4	positive	The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
79_ 21	neutral	If you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.
166_ 32	neutral	These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !
185_ 4	neutral	I am the type of person that will always go against the masses of blind followers so there was no way I was getting an Ipod.
132_ 247	neutral	 Now if you do decide to take the iPod on the road, my suggestion is to forego any purchasing of the FM Transmitter devices, unless you live out in the middle of Mississipi because frankly, you'll need a next-clear FM channel on your radio to get any sembelance of a clear signal.
220_ 15	positive	Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.
147_ 2	negative	It is not reliable.
130_ 2	positive	This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
84_ 1	positive	There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
103_ 6	neutral	The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
225_ 7	neutral	What happens follows:       Let's start with the software.
0_ 61	positive	Audio is mono and fairly acceptable, quiet also with little distortions.
132_ 526	neutral	Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?
192_ 4	positive	Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.
155_ 4	positive	All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.
142_ 10	neutral	YOU WON'T get connected otherwise.
187_ 5	neutral	The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).
205_ 7	positive	One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player.
242_ 20	neutral	Less Benz/obvious; more Audi/understated.
195_ 3	neutral	Remember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.
213_ 23	neutral	The new firmware fixes this as long as you put the player in lock mode before plugging it into said PC.
183_ 21	neutral	The recharge cord will do the job in a fraction of the time that the USB cable will hooked to your computer.
213_ 8	positive	+Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right?
0_ 111	positive	I still can't believe how fast it starts up.
0_ 143	neutral	If you like to take a look at some pictures shot with this camera by a mediocre photographer please feel fee to check out my picture page at http://community.webshots.com/user/mbs60099
299_ 17	neutral	Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...
34_ 0	neutral	got this as it flew off the shelves.
35_ 20	neutral	1600x1200 means really good, cropped 5x7 prints and acceptable 8x10s.
169_ 15	neutral	Great items !
224_ 13	neutral	This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.
255_ 11	neutral	In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.
195_ 2	neutral	If you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.
324_ 0	negative	I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
127_ 9	neutral	I am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.
0_ 46	neutral	Camera has been treated with kid gloves since day one.
183_ 32	negative	If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. .
278_ 7	positive	it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!
185_ 7	negative	and supply those stupid white Headphones.
57_ 1	neutral	Having one of these helps from needing to take out the trash daily for the guys!
322_ 0	neutral	I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.
217_ 16	neutral	I'm not professing to be a consumer-survey corporation, but I don't know *anyone* with an iTunes account.
143_ 5	positive	A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.
255_ 7	neutral	I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.
190_ 25	neutral	If you do not care about sound/music quality in the least, and don't mind the ability to store 800 songs less than promised, get the creative zen micro.
313_ 1	neutral	It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.
251_ 0	neutral	Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......
225_ 37	neutral	It's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.
260_ 1	positive	Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
35_ 14	positive	The panorama modes are wonderful.
236_ 1	neutral	I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.
242_ 18	neutral	Few will look at the phone and know it's 'all that'.
212_ 17	neutral	he Pencil?
132_ 495	neutral	 It's got LOTS of pros, and a couple minor cons, which I will outline below.
265_ 2	positive	I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
101_ 1	neutral	Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.
256_ 3	positive	Photos are pretty darned good!
324_ 1	negative	Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
199_ 1	neutral	I really like both of them and as with any other popular products, they both have their share of negative reviews warning of their shortcomings.
39_ 2	neutral	I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.
137_ 2	positive	Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.
298_ 4	neutral	I don't have one good thing to say.
198_ 9	negative	I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.
115_ 7	neutral	If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
221_ 10	neutral	Capacity?
269_ 1	neutral	I also am loving T-Mobile (100 times better than ATT...
273_ 0	neutral	Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
109_ 2	negative	The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
246_ 5	negative	The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
208_ 7	neutral	Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.
79_ 13	neutral	You can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.
221_ 15	positive	Tough as nails.
214_ 6	positive	I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.
132_ 491	neutral	Not perfect, but I'm still enamored...  I've had an iRiver MP3 player for a year or so now, and it's really great for listening to the radio.
151_ 8	positive	Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
0_ 29	positive	Sharper pictures.
87_ 3	positive	I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
203_ 5	negative	Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.
318_ 1	positive	This is also the case with NIS 2004.
50_ 0	positive	I, as many others, have waited for many years for the convergence of price, features, size and ease of use to hit that happy center point.
270_ 14	positive	Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
170_ 15	neutral	The UPnP and NAT traversal features have some kinks that will be hopefully fixed in the later versions of the firmware.
0_ 211	positive	This camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation.
91_ 2	neutral	Even when empty!
204_ 2	positive	It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.
268_ 16	positive	The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
289_ 0	negative	I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
287_ 30	negative	A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
114_ 11	negative	I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
275_ 9	negative	but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.
166_ 31	neutral	You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.
234_ 0	negative	I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
132_ 176	negative	 The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.
132_ 33	neutral	If your battery dies and it's still under warranty, guess what, you're out of luck, because Apple doesn't cover the battery in the iPod warranty.
224_ 9	neutral	I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.
204_ 3	positive	Creative did an awesome job with the design.
132_ 487	neutral	Amazing.
166_ 19	neutral	For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.
218_ 3	neutral	My big Zen has hundreds of CDs on it, but this little player will store my most listened to tunes, or songs Iwant to download for free from the Yahoo site, "test drive", then decide if I want to download permanently into my larger Creative.
190_ 24	negative	I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.
110_ 12	positive	The soft start is nice.
79_ 16	neutral	Don't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?
287_ 33	negative	You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
193_ 7	neutral	The player was large and bulky.
275_ 1	neutral	all the other features are gravy.
313_ 2	neutral	THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.
131_ 14	positive	But, for the money it is a good machine.
81_ 0	neutral	When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.
253_ 5	positive	The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
105_ 3	neutral	Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.
131_ 7	neutral	But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.
220_ 10	negative	It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.
132_ 199	neutral	 It is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.
298_ 18	neutral	But I don't think SystemWorks 2005 will start acting up.
193_ 2	neutral	They have a list of compatible players which I miss read.
133_ 2	positive	By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.
189_ 20	positive	The battery is removable.
242_ 41	neutral	In my humble opinion, games, along w/ 'flip phones' belong in the hands of teenagers.
211_ 25	positive	It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.
123_ 3	negative	It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
215_ 4	neutral	Also if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review...." My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.
168_ 0	neutral	OK, I never read the manual.
76_ 3	neutral	4 months later.
225_ 3	positive	The Zen offered a great alternative.
132_ 201	neutral	After hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.
138_ 20	neutral	I would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !
177_ 0	positive	Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
253_ 4	neutral	But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.
214_ 2	neutral	However, as soon as I found out that I could only download songs from iTunes, I immediately decided that was NOT the MP3 player for me.
50_ 1	neutral	Well wait no more!
0_ 101	positive	if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer.
242_ 43	positive	There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
132_ 496	neutral	It's still an absolutely unbeatable value for the amazing technology you're getting, so don't let a few petty cons dissaude you from owning THE coolest thing on the planet right now for any music lover.
268_ 8	neutral	The KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.
202_ 0	neutral	It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?
132_ 134	neutral	Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.
134_ 4	negative	It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.
132_ 511	neutral	  It's very fast and easy to create custom playlists for upload.
316_ 1	positive	All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
0_ 22	positive	They say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact.
202_ 1	negative	The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad.
209_ 18	neutral	Something about the pictures suggests a deck-of-cards size, but you can hide the Micro completely under a standard business card.
191_ 19	neutral	- The FM Radio.
106_ 14	neutral	This will allow operation of the power switch with the left index finger and the plunge lock with the left thumb (instead of the standard right thumb and right index finger, respectively), but then the depth scale is on the back face of the router, as is the straight edge of the base plate.
132_ 135	neutral	 I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.
324_ 9	negative	I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
324_ 8	negative	I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
266_ 3	positive	The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.
99_ 2	positive	I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.
94_ 2	positive	I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
183_ 0	neutral	Two days after writing this review below, I want to remove another two stars.
144_ 7	neutral	If you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.
250_ 5	negative	This process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.
298_ 5	neutral	I agree with the other reviewer that it doesn't even deserve 1 star.
270_ 16	neutral	It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
228_ 5	neutral	Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.
110_ 6	positive	No vibration!
213_ 5	positive	the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does.
166_ 73	neutral	Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.
132_ 219	neutral	You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.
225_ 42	neutral	chargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.
211_ 23	neutral	To me, currently at $218, this player is a!
119_ 1	positive	It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
250_ 14	negative	Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
73_ 3	neutral	Here's what we love about this pail.
127_ 3	positive	I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
225_ 55	neutral	I know what you are thinking.
229_ 3	neutral	However, their player seems to be defective and Creative Labs should be contacted before making such harsh statements if they haven't been contacted already.
131_ 18	positive	For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
0_ 156	positive	As it turns out, this is an awesome camera!
0_ 216	positive	I have a Canon A 70 , and now this SD500, its amazing, how this little camera produces, such great pics, it even brings out ur pimples on the face.
239_ 4	neutral	Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
132_ 139	positive	 In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
253_ 3	negative	Yes, certainly.
163_ 9	neutral	uter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).
221_ 20	positive	) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.
170_ 7	neutral	After installing the firmware hold the reset button at the back for 30 secs.
132_ 467	positive	I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
3_ 7	neutral	However, I do have a few things to complain about...
189_ 30	positive	The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.
140_ 6	neutral	Nope.
166_ 55	neutral	This is especially true if you don't need the!
189_ 0	neutral	This is a difficult player to review because I would recommend it on a case-by-case basis.
136_ 16	neutral	When I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.
128_ 4	neutral	It works well with the larger bits.
193_ 1	neutral	Loved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.
73_ 8	neutral	Spraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.
257_ 2	positive	Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
173_ 2	neutral	Got the Linksys after reading some reviews.
184_ 0	positive	Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
132_ 437	positive	 Has a great helpline.
183_ 17	neutral	2.
227_ 8	neutral	It makes USB 2.0 feel like USB 1.1.
66_ 6	positive	I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
207_ 10	negative	They obviously have quality and reliability problems.
199_ 12	negative	While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
221_ 8	neutral	Let's just say it's no coincidence I put "Foxy Lady" on there.
135_ 2	neutral	I run on Mac OSX, and though I considered getting the whole Apple airport setup, the cost difference between the Airport and the latest model Linksys pretty much left no comparison.
132_ 100	positive	Games-- not really important, but existant
1_ 0	positive	I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
132_ 183	neutral	Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).
26_ 0	positive	The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
227_ 16	neutral	The player intelligently pre-buffers the next song.
189_ 14	neutral	Also, as soon as you select a song and set your desired volume level, put the player on HOLD.
132_ 420	neutral	 I ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.
131_ 9	negative	Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
132_ 119	negative	The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').
116_ 8	negative	It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
201_ 30	positive	Colors: 10 variety of HOT colors made it difficult to choose from.
132_ 288	positive	 The!  sound quality is great.
135_ 15	negative	I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
13_ 3	negative	When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
178_ 24	negative	Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc.
223_ 3	positive	it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.
108_ 9	neutral	The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a "ball park" measure.
122_ 6	neutral	Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.
35_ 12	positive	The macro mode works well, although it takes some practice since the camera doesn't clearly indicate when it can't focus.
287_ 15	negative	First, it serious, serious installation problems.
187_ 11	positive	The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.
296_ 2	negative	Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
205_ 2	positive	I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date.
246_ 7	positive	The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
229_ 13	positive	By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.
89_ 5	positive	No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
275_ 2	neutral	i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.
132_ 129	neutral	 To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.
183_ 43	positive	) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. .
256_ 7	negative	I mean, they're short!
307_ 3	negative	You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
268_ 20	negative	Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
0_ 8	negative	I thought given all the "10" reviews about this camera that I would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey.
70_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
240_ 2	positive	I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
233_ 30	neutral	Now that is neat.
132_ 264	neutral	 However, with the iPod you cannot.

31_ 10	negative	When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
83_ 3	neutral	It takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.
263_ 12	neutral	the stand by is really good considering all the toys this phone has and the screen size!
265_ 5	positive	I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
229_ 6	positive	However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.
243_ 20	neutral	That's because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile's tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn't about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.
302_ 0	positive	I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
205_ 19	positive	I've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces, and it still works flawlessly.
132_ 385	neutral	 Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.
270_ 3	positive	The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.
132_ 241	negative	  My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up.
112_ 7	negative	The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
174_ 8	neutral	BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.
233_ 24	positive	I click pictures in JPG format and because the phone has a bluetooth device I find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth.
277_ 1	positive	Picture and video quality is ok.
132_ 524	neutral	That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.
231_ 2	negative	Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
186_ 10	neutral	I did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.
82_ 4	neutral	The latch isn't terribly difficult, and I wouldn't want it to be too easy since it sits in my son's room.
116_ 0	positive	I love the performance and features of this router.
142_ 12	neutral	Also some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.
132_ 153	neutral	There's got to be a better solution...

213_ 18	neutral	just as well and would be less confusing for new owners, but i guess they wanted to rival the iPod's search wheel.
178_ 17	neutral	Best decision I've made in a long time.
0_ 104	negative	Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.
166_ 74	neutral	Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.
71_ 1	neutral	As a first-time mom, I got the great idea that cloth would be better, and this was the only diaper disposal that advertised compatibility with cloth diapers.
210_ 7	neutral	And t!
206_ 0	neutral	Every few years I crawl out into the electronic world, in search of a new MP3 player to replace the horribly inadequate one I currently own.
0_ 194	positive	Neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings.
183_ 12	neutral	Why isn't it?
324_ 5	neutral	I just about lost it this morning with this software.
138_ 19	neutral	But if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.
219_ 2	neutral	Check out message boards on Napster for more info.
257_ 3	negative	The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
246_ 4	negative	Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
134_ 6	neutral	These are just some of the pathetic examples.
5_ 8	negative	2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.
132_ 250	negative	  If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
132_ 26	neutral	The Click Wheel is a great design, something no one else came up with (however, the iRiver has a touchpad).
221_ 0	neutral	If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.
132_ 55	positive	This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.
217_ 17	neutral	However, I do know about a dozen people with well over 4000 MP3s each.
99_ 5	neutral	We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.
319_ 0	neutral	I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).
27_ 0	positive	If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
195_ 39	neutral	This is a must have.
0_ 34	neutral	Once I have the time, I plan to explore all the high end features of the camera, but for now, I can't comment intelligently or fairly.
132_ 277	neutral	 This seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.
205_ 14	negative	The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area.
98_ 2	neutral	I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?
132_ 236	neutral	  My only regret is that I bought the 20GB model, which is way too big for what I really need: I would have been better off with a smaller model of lower capacity.
102_ 1	positive	From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
267_ 11	positive	I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
239_ 1	positive	I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
132_ 400	negative	 Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.
29_ 1	positive	I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
0_ 35	negative	The only knock I have is that the flash is underpowered.
212_ 3	negative	As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.
32_ 14	neutral	And there are two more advantages to digital photography  which I hadn't anticipated, beyond the lack of film and developing.
193_ 55	neutral	Overall this play is my introduction into the market.
195_ 34	neutral	Instead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.
201_ 6	neutral	I waited a week to make the Micro worthy of a review.
0_ 85	positive	i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips, i give it 5/5 stars =) oh and btw, while you take video clips, you can zoom it too! (digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
108_ 2	positive	I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
132_ 523	neutral	Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.

194_ 7	positive	I love the touchpade controls.
53_ 2	neutral	I also sprinkled baking soda in the bottom of the Diaper Champ to help absorb odors - every once in awhile I just empty the old baking soda out and replace it.
243_ 22	neutral	So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.
140_ 9	neutral	No hold time.
91_ 8	neutral	However, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -
76_ 2	neutral	I have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.
239_ 0	neutral	Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
187_ 17	positive	Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.
267_ 12	positive	Very simple and painless.
217_ 13	neutral	Today, the Creative Zen Micro proves it, too, gets it right.
0_ 12	neutral	The camera was sitting on my home desk waiting for the new digital card and the weekend for the first round of serious shooting.

193_ 4	neutral	To transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.
215_ 8	neutral	When you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.
132_ 492	neutral	 It's small and lightweight, but it has very little storage space and the shape is clunky.
188_ 3	neutral	by broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.
251_ 11	negative	4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
5_ 14	neutral	Canon says it's normal.
132_ 327	positive	Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
265_ 13	negative	On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.
241_ 19	negative	I wouldn't use it for business purposes and hand one out to all my employees, because you tend to want a little more rugged a phone for that.
132_ 7	negative	 It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod.
122_ 2	neutral	I bought it!
199_ 4	neutral	Not to mention that everyone else at the office has an IPod, so I was kinda' hoping for a good alternative.
146_ 8	positive	Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.
0_ 55	neutral	Expected better from a $500 unit.
225_ 63	neutral	Exactly, warranty voided.
217_ 12	neutral	The iPod gets it right, the Carbon doesn't.
110_ 15	positive	Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
128_ 6	positive	It has plenty of power.
191_ 3	positive	I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).
132_ 483	negative	 The only problem is the battery life.
132_ 442	neutral	 Warranty expires only after a year.
5_ 10	negative	3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
280_ 0	negative	I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
205_ 9	positive	Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking.
132_ 429	positive	 Overall, this product is AWESOME.
238_ 1	positive	since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
5_ 2	neutral	I had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.
0_ 181	negative	The buttons are rather stiff.
155_ 0	neutral	I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.
44_ 0	neutral	OK so I bookmarked pages about this camera on our home computer, in a place I was sure my wife would see, and loh and behold, what did I get.
309_ 0	negative	The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
217_ 21	positive	The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.
135_ 21	negative	* I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable.
174_ 11	neutral	If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!
116_ 9	positive	Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
270_ 9	negative	Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
132_ 309	neutral	 Think about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.
216_ 2	negative	The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.
287_ 23	neutral	Without this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.
132_ 345	negative	However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.
132_ 262	neutral	  THE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.
250_ 10	neutral	All I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select "calling card call".
211_ 21	positive	White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag.
132_ 399	neutral	 Needless to say, these are fragile machines.
192_ 7	neutral	I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.
100_ 0	neutral	Don't listen to the bad reviews!
155_ 1	positive	As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.
127_ 1	positive	It doesn't bog down under load.
213_ 28	negative	) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long.
186_ 1	neutral	With so many choices it was a tough decision.
132_ 172	neutral	You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.
96_ 1	positive	It works easily with one hand, which is important.
298_ 7	neutral	It's a well-known company that I expected more from and spent 2 hours with tech support running all kinds of tests on the computer which of course came back reporting no trouble with the computer.
132_ 347	neutral	Good, But Not For Everyone
132_ 354	neutral	While they have released those "tattoos" for the players, I think those just look cheap and gaudy, especially since they leave the corners of the iPod exposed.
151_ 5	neutral	I used Linksys technical support several times.
269_ 2	positive	you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour!).
192_ 3	neutral	I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.
104_ 3	negative	If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
228_ 0	neutral	Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.
0_ 110	positive	This camera takes amazing pictures and its size cannot be beat.
132_ 133	positive	Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.
211_ 8	neutral	So starting out i knew i wanted a windows friendly player.
166_ 27	neutral	This is what is commonly called a firewall.
266_ 0	positive	The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.
243_ 36	neutral	I suggested that it didn't make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.
256_ 4	negative	DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
132_ 284	positive	 The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
199_ 13	positive	As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song.
296_ 0	neutral	I have had Norton Internet Security for 3 yrs and up graded to 2004 versionin August 2004.
205_ 1	positive	Overall, I've been very impressed with the player.

74_ 3	positive	It works with a minimum of fuss.
103_ 0	neutral	I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.
146_ 13	positive	Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.
299_ 4	neutral	After finally restarting, the "automatic updates" ran.
132_ 475	neutral	 The first time I took it in the car, and was able to chose from hundreds of CD titles, thousands of songs, to have all of that at my fingertips was a great experience.
183_ 16	neutral	The company has received thousands of complaints about this and refuses to do anything about it. .
249_ 4	positive	The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
298_ 14	neutral	The SystemWorks 2005 seems to be working GREAT!!
166_ 14	neutral	It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.
15_ 19	positive	You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
268_ 9	positive	I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
215_ 9	negative	I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.
314_ 1	neutral	At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!
0_ 161	negative	I also own a Canon Digital Rebel and I agree that the advanced controls on the SD500 are not as robust, but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the Digital Rebel.
299_ 12	negative	I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
81_ 6	neutral	I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.
125_ 7	positive	Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
191_ 27	neutral	They seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.
207_ 0	neutral	UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.
79_ 14	neutral	Special bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.
213_ 4	neutral	anyway, here's the pros and cons:  +linux compatible with the 1.x series of firmware.
132_ 402	neutral	 The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.
221_ 18	positive	Flawless.
311_ 14	positive	It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
232_ 1	negative	3660 had similar features, but that is big in size.
201_ 25	positive	Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*.
132_ 147	neutral	 i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.
178_ 15	neutral	But my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?
233_ 10	neutral	2. The looks are absolutely no nonsensical.
206_ 24	positive	That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!
89_ 14	neutral	All I do is wipe it down with some antibacterial wipes (takes about 10 seconds!!) and then maybe spray some Lysol in it and let it air out for a minute or two.
179_ 3	neutral	Two walls apart from it, the signal would start failing.
0_ 59	positive	I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).
0_ 98	neutral	as a whole, i say, it's way more than what i expected.
243_ 4	neutral	The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn't help.
166_ 3	neutral	Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.
99_ 3	neutral	I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.
274_ 17	positive	The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".
15_ 6	neutral	The LCD should be used.
242_ 33	negative	The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
111_ 0	neutral	Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.
132_ 118	positive	I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.
225_ 35	negative	But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.
240_ 4	positive	The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
324_ 11	negative	Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
189_ 42	neutral	You can only copy songs you've downloaded for free or ripped from a CD.
166_ 71	neutral	They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.
225_ 28	neutral	It's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.
122_ 3	neutral	I have 5 routers, I use them all!
211_ 2	neutral	I've owned this player for nine months now and it's been on 5 cross country trips, one trans-atlantic honeymoon, and numerous roadtrips.
132_ 401	neutral	I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.
118_ 5	positive	You'll love it!
233_ 2	negative	I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
45_ 2	neutral	I also recently bought Viking's IntelliFlash Memory Reader.
135_ 20	neutral	I don't mind if the instructions are online instead of in the box, but please have some instructions *somewhere.
178_ 22	positive	I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.
32_ 9	positive	The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
201_ 1	neutral	Why not join the iPodders like the rest of the world?
92_ 0	positive	I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
227_ 7	negative	Right now, the Creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly.
129_ 6	neutral	The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.
16_ 2	positive	It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
25_ 0	positive	This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
132_ 279	neutral	Confused yet? Don't be.
311_ 16	neutral	Once you set it up, you barely even notice it's even there.
221_ 9	positive	Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.
32_ 0	neutral	I'm a writer and new to digital photography.
211_ 22	neutral	Also all the required cables and what not.
128_ 11	negative	I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
65_ 5	neutral	Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.
306_ 5	neutral	I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.
166_ 2	neutral	You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.
132_ 124	negative	 First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.
80_ 0	neutral	My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.
224_ 1	negative	Unfortunately I was wrong.
152_ 0	neutral	Now that the 11g spec is final, and a new firmware has been released supporting it, the WRT54G is a serious contender for your wireless network.
265_ 15	positive	With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.
208_ 15	neutral	You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.
253_ 0	positive	I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
193_ 35	positive	Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.
275_ 13	neutral	this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.
245_ 1	positive	It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
227_ 21	neutral	The subscription service lets me download as much as I want, and the player lets me take it wherever I go.
211_ 12	neutral	When it's being used or charged it emits a low pulsating blue light.
207_ 28	positive	I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.
132_ 146	neutral	i didnt touch the product.
132_ 151	neutral	 the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.
187_ 10	negative	The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.
110_ 14	positive	The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
141_ 2	neutral	For about the same price as 11mb you can get 5 times the speed.
7_ 2	positive	Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
275_ 6	neutral	there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.
207_ 18	negative	es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.
268_ 15	positive	You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
299_ 6	negative	Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
108_ 14	neutral	I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.
119_ 2	neutral	I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!
88_ 2	positive	It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
127_ 2	positive	Cuts are easy and smooth.
0_ 210	positive	I love the camera.
132_ 216	neutral	They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.
91_ 9	positive	Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
65_ 1	neutral	and what a Godsend!
71_ 13	neutral	It lives up to its name.
166_ 63	neutral	Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.
70_ 4	neutral	Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.
0_ 105	neutral	The pictures tend to get blurry due to longer exposure, but his can be disabled in the manual settings.
154_ 12	positive	I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.
278_ 4	negative	you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).
89_ 8	neutral	1. CHANGE BAGS FREQUENTLY!!
208_ 14	neutral	I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).
233_ 39	neutral	When I purchased this phone , I thought to myself that I had purchased the most popular phone around and the thought didn't please me.
78_ 4	neutral	Every time!
260_ 0	positive	This phone is fantastic.
36_ 9	neutral	2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!
110_ 8	positive	It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
132_ 67	neutral	 I actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.
144_ 12	neutral	However, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.
218_ 2	positive	This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.
132_ 260	positive	For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
311_ 12	neutral	A security software suite with lots of value
225_ 50	neutral	It comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.
10_ 2	neutral	It's best to list the pros and cons of this camera:
287_ 22	negative	The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
246_ 6	positive	The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
191_ 6	neutral	Just in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.
70_ 5	positive	And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
306_ 11	negative	Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
139_ 13	neutral	So, if you type in "Linksys firmware" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).
132_ 187	neutral	About 1/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.
132_ 127	negative	In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
81_ 1	neutral	We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.
117_ 0	positive	I purchased two of these beauties.
55_ 1	positive	I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
207_ 6	neutral	They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.
263_ 9	positive	The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
43_ 3	negative	Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 "adjust levels" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.
169_ 11	positive	My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.
318_ 0	positive	I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
206_ 1	positive	This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.
132_ 239	neutral	The iPod does come with other nifty software accoutrements, but honestly I haven't used them much as I use the iPod to listen to music while I run or on a plane.
132_ 144	neutral	simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!
132_ 358	neutral	 I disagree.
224_ 12	neutral	I don't want to keep testing my luck.
132_ 329	neutral	 Organizing music is a breeze too.
103_ 3	positive	The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
89_ 1	positive	I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
206_ 19	negative	While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer).
243_ 37	negative	This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
225_ 49	negative	Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.
40_ 0	neutral	I have a 35mm camera outfit that cost quite a bit of money a few years ago.
35_ 13	positive	The white-LED backlit LCD is very bright and crisp, even in sunlight, and relatively easy on the battery.
140_ 8	neutral	A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.
132_ 89	negative	 One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
258_ 5	negative	So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,
114_ 3	positive	Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
194_ 14	positive	It's faster than WMP.
125_ 5	neutral	As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.
198_ 8	neutral	They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my "jukebox" needed to be purged.
251_ 7	negative	2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
232_ 7	positive	Goes ~3 days after a charge.
0_ 43	neutral	I have had the SD500 for less than one week.
132_ 256	neutral	 If you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.
51_ 2	neutral	You can take it anywhere withyou, unlike other bulky cameras, and capture every moment of yourlife.
54_ 8	positive	There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
132_ 117	positive	Versatile and stylish.
179_ 19	neutral	In my oppinion,!
242_ 40	negative	Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
115_ 4	negative	Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
0_ 135	positive	Fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket.
254_ 5	positive	Nokia makes great phones, and this one is the cream of the crop.
233_ 43	neutral	gee anyways ENJOY WHAT WORKS!
290_ 9	positive	You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
146_ 6	neutral	You won't regret it.
132_ 426	neutral	There is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.
106_ 2	neutral	Luckily, the only significant handheld use I had to put it to was to plunge cut the melamine board that I dropped my Woodpeckers PlungeLIFT table insert into.
191_ 8	positive	The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.
242_ 52	negative	I would suggest this phone for all but the simple-minded... or those who simply don't need so many features.
255_ 8	positive	All at the same time, and all without a hitch.
21_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.
132_ 212	neutral	  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)
131_ 12	negative	Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
293_ 2	negative	It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
128_ 8	negative	Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
32_ 15	neutral	One is  the lack of censorship of your photos -- time for some, uh, fashion  photography of your wife or girlfriend, if that's something you both would  enjoy!
270_ 5	positive	It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.
289_ 3	negative	And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
265_ 14	positive	And Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.
76_ 0	positive	I love this pail!
142_ 1	neutral	A great service which I highly recommend.
127_ 0	positive	I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
126_ 4	positive	I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
132_ 359	neutral	 I strongly suggest anyone considering an iPod test it out first to see how they like it.
264_ 2	neutral	Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
287_ 5	neutral	It has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.
132_ 430	positive	 All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.
132_ 120	positive	The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
132_ 87	neutral	I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.
194_ 16	positive	If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player.
132_ 92	neutral	This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.
220_ 16	positive	As I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.
0_ 169	positive	If you want a sharp looking, fast digital camera and you don't need or want manual controls, then this is the camera for you!
242_ 29	neutral	If you're still whining about storage, deleting some games will free-up still more memory.
166_ 52	neutral	Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.
132_ 251	neutral	 I mean, it would be nice if one day, iTunes can actually offer their customers a monthly service that allows iPod owners to load their iPods up with unlimited music with one set fee, as an option to the pay-99cents-a-track path.
170_ 1	positive	I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler.
242_ 14	positive	DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
117_ 4	neutral	My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.
163_ 8	neutral	In the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!
132_ 166	neutral	Buyer beware!
214_ 11	positive	And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.
0_ 86	positive	photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)
61_ 0	negative	I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
0_ 171	positive	 am so glad I bought this camera.
166_ 41	positive	Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.
132_ 514	neutral	 It's really no big deal to me, but is worth mentioning.
111_ 6	positive	It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
135_ 11	negative	I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless.
118_ 1	neutral	This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.
12_ 0	positive	It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
132_ 253	neutral	 I go everywhere with it, on campus, in the gym and at work too !
135_ 10	neutral	) After messing about a bit with the CD, I went online to the Linksys site to look for support tips.
82_ 0	positive	It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
36_ 3	neutral	I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.
319_ 9	neutral	I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.
169_ 8	positive	The setup software did everything.
256_ 2	positive	I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
77_ 1	negative	I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
114_ 5	neutral	I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.
201_ 27	positive	Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes.
204_ 1	positive	the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.
178_ 25	neutral	If you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.
138_ 15	neutral	But knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.
132_ 295	neutral	 I had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.
135_ 24	positive	Once you set it up, it's great.
32_ 10	positive	The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
124_ 5	positive	The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
112_ 8	neutral	Unless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.
251_ 14	negative	I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
40_ 1	positive	So, why the small Digital Elph, rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality?
287_ 24	neutral	Without updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!
192_ 2	positive	The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.
278_ 0	positive	INCREDIBLE MEMORY!
166_ 61	neutral	The other issue is how secure do you want it.
193_ 36	positive	It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.
174_ 9	neutral	SSID are like filenames in Windows.
166_ 21	neutral	Many if not most cable / DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!
268_ 30	positive	But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
154_ 9	positive	The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.
166_ 22	neutral	from the cable modem you are using.
232_ 4	positive	Especially the LCD is big and the camera quality is among the very best around.
154_ 3	positive	The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).
138_ 9	neutral	I do know what wires go !
31_ 15	neutral	By the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.
209_ 20	neutral	You quickly learn to brush your thumb ever so lightly over its surface.
227_ 5	negative	I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.
170_ 16	neutral	But this seems to be isolated only to the latest version of this particular program.
192_ 8	neutral	I get occasional hiss while driving.
184_ 7	positive	This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.
225_ 31	neutral	Once I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).
54_ 6	neutral	We decided we had to have something so we started researching.
68_ 5	positive	And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
132_ 111	neutral	I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.
132_ 383	positive	For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.
132_ 328	neutral	 To adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.
197_ 0	neutral	This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.
205_ 11	positive	The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example).
223_ 13	neutral	This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.
201_ 31	positive	You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable.
287_ 9	negative	This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
320_ 3	neutral	I used "Add/Remove Programs" to unistall NIS 2003.
173_ 0	neutral	I'm going to be moving soon.
136_ 30	positive	Installation was as near automatic as can be.
132_ 342	neutral	Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.
213_ 29	positive	But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.
132_ 375	neutral	Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.
297_ 2	negative	If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
132_ 298	positive	 With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.
314_ 5	neutral	BEWARE!!!!
251_ 12	neutral	5- If you already have a girlfriend and/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .
139_ 1	negative	This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.
270_ 8	negative	They really are awfully small.
19_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
266_ 5	positive	Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.
79_ 26	positive	Let the Champ win you over!
132_ 155	negative	 *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.
165_ 1	neutral	My new Toshiba M35-S359's Wi-Fi capabilities became apparent when I took it on th eroad over Thanksgiving.
104_ 1	positive	The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
195_ 14	neutral	Remember this is a huge plus when travelling.
256_ 1	positive	UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
0_ 134	positive	The size of the camera is perfect.
0_ 112	positive	I take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice.
233_ 35	negative	The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
195_ 9	positive	You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).
75_ 4	positive	Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
192_ 10	neutral	 Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.
110_ 2	neutral	Before buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.
103_ 5	positive	Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
193_ 52	positive	The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
186_ 2	neutral	My first instinct was to go with an iPod.
0_ 44	negative	After reading reviews of LCD problems, cracked, black blobs etc, I figured that it was probably a very limited problem.
132_ 373	neutral	This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.
124_ 4	positive	The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
132_ 282	neutral	  THE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!
202_ 2	negative	But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
79_ 5	neutral	One pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.
287_ 16	negative	Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
132_ 343	negative	  This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
237_ 0	negative	who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
287_ 25	positive	Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
54_ 9	positive	We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
111_ 11	negative	Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
166_ 4	negative	Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.
248_ 6	neutral	I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.
132_ 125	neutral	 So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.
197_ 5	neutral	The karma also has a very long battery life.
107_ 3	neutral	It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
195_ 12	neutral	Zen micro does.
143_ 7	neutral	i've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.
212_ 16	neutral	Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!
151_ 3	neutral	I had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.
317_ 1	negative	I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
150_ 3	neutral	If you buy, you should disable the SSID Broadcast, use MAC filtering and deploy some form of encryption (multiple choices)if you want to ensure your network is secure (all covered off in the manual).
311_ 0	negative	I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
132_ 45	positive	 Very sturdy and strong.
166_ 28	neutral	You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.
132_ 474	neutral	You can adjust the time the backlight stays on (or turn it off completely), so it's only a minor issue.
166_ 51	neutral	If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.
183_ 23	neutral	Infuriating! Nearly all other MP-3 producing companies include a recharging cord with their product that can be plugged into a wall socket.
268_ 4	positive	One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
190_ 11	negative	First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made.
132_ 79	negative	 The interface took a little getting used to.
131_ 5	neutral	I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.
221_ 28	positive	In conclusion, this player is beautiful.
117_ 9	positive	The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
132_ 99	positive	Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy
241_ 17	negative	My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
233_ 14	neutral	There's a whole lot of things you can do with this phone besides reading a book , playing various Java games , having a variety of software installed.
190_ 30	neutral	player[-][s]However, this one makes an ipod sound like your old LP's, so even if you're a casual listener, I'd advise that you avoid the purchase of this product. Terrible.
132_ 27	negative	I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software.
0_ 139	positive	there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things.
178_ 2	neutral	However I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).
225_ 60	negative	The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.
215_ 14	positive	This is really a no brainer.
69_ 1	neutral	Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.
0_ 27	neutral	The quality, detail and clarity is much better than the Sony in my opinion.
255_ 13	positive	If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
166_ 35	neutral	Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.
0_ 126	neutral	My SD500 was kept in a case all the time if not being used.
189_ 12	neutral	1.
203_ 0	negative	Still has terrible software.
321_ 3	negative	Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
100_ 9	positive	We don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!
166_ 24	neutral	In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.
5_ 13	negative	It is hot enough to be annoying.
287_ 44	negative	Avoid this product at all costs.
5_ 9	negative	This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
250_ 0	positive	I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.
139_ 14	neutral	The really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be.
209_ 7	positive	Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.
136_ 4	neutral	They strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.
132_ 30	neutral	Anyhow, adding music to the player is easy.
323_ 8	neutral	I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.
132_ 206	neutral	Why would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?
231_ 5	positive	It has it all.
207_ 14	positive	I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.
122_ 7	positive	The M12V has been great.
191_ 2	positive	Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.
0_ 103	positive	I bought this camera two days ago, and I'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money.
149_ 1	negative	The installation software CD crashed repeatedly.
71_ 10	neutral	I'm beginning to think that the main reason Genie's so popular is their cutesy name.
68_ 3	neutral	We all hated it.
122_ 0	neutral	At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.
132_ 91	neutral	Here's the TRUTH in short....
146_ 10	neutral	No more connection!
132_ 3	negative	 There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
71_ 2	neutral	She never wore even one- the hospital started me on Huggies, and I never turned back (as a side note- if you do have the patience for cloth diapers, pay the extra $ and go for Kushies; they're beautifully made and work very well from what I've heard).
25_ 4	positive	The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
106_ 11	neutral	Not included are: - 3/8" chuck sleeve (the least common bit size) - depth scale in mm (the included one is in inches) - dust collector set - trimmer guide for chamfering
232_ 2	positive	6600 looks and feels nice.
75_ 3	neutral	The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.
209_ 29	positive	Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.
193_ 54	neutral	I believe them.
123_ 7	negative	I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
79_ 22	negative	The other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.
174_ 6	neutral	I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).
147_ 3	negative	A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.
66_ 8	neutral	I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.
320_ 5	neutral	After that was complete, I deleted the Norton Antivirus and Norton Internet Security folders left in the "Programs" section of Windows XP.
100_ 17	neutral	To replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.
251_ 6	negative	1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
264_ 4	neutral	You have to wait to get your second bill before you can send the rebate form in. \
187_ 20	positive	The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.
132_ 346	neutral	 Hence, the one star rating...
94_ 0	positive	Excellent diaper disposal unit.
15_ 1	neutral	I have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.
221_ 30	positive	But it; you won't regret it.
183_ 40	negative	IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed.
266_ 1	negative	The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.
192_ 15	neutral	I wish they has a "lock" function like cell phones to prevent this.
132_ 178	neutral	 The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.
133_ 7	neutral	I do not really know why some people are tearing this router !
306_ 16	neutral	They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.
239_ 5	negative	Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
229_ 7	positive	Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
208_ 16	positive	Overall, I am very pleased with it.
132_ 78	neutral	I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.
229_ 0	positive	I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned.
250_ 12	negative	In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
268_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.
243_ 12	negative	Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
281_ 3	neutral	I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.
256_ 10	negative	Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
306_ 8	negative	Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
225_ 46	neutral	It's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).
142_ 7	neutral	,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.
1_ 6	negative	Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
222_ 3	positive	The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.
206_ 16	positive	So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
195_ 16	neutral	If one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.
81_ 4	negative	We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
202_ 3	neutral	What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?
214_ 16	neutral	One was the firmware upgrading from the installation CD and the second was regarding the "playforsure" (even though it's in BETA), to make sure I could use Napster 2 Go.
320_ 8	positive	I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
166_ 0	neutral	First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.
1_ 2	positive	I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
189_ 22	neutral	With the iPod, if the battery has reached it's life span (after about a year), and you didn't buy the warranty from the store, you need to buy a NEW player.
166_ 58	neutral	My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.
192_ 6	negative	Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.
284_ 1	negative	Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
166_ 46	positive	This model appears to be especially good.
0_ 124	neutral	In response to "testing" the LCD through pressure in the center and sides, I am glad that it did not cause any damage.
243_ 29	neutral	I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.
213_ 15	neutral	it's a little counter intuitive at first, but works great when your used to it.
215_ 5	positive	However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.
228_ 9	positive	It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.
25_ 6	negative	My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
225_ 57	neutral	If only only it was that simple.
154_ 6	neutral	Setting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!
15_ 0	neutral	I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.
172_ 3	positive	Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.
37_ 0	negative	i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100, and of course i got the latter!
56_ 0	positive	It's far better than all others on the market.
0_ 218	neutral	Once I learned how to use the diferent features, it is much easier than my old one to use and view pics.
298_ 34	neutral	Trust me and all the other reviews on this one.
195_ 7	negative	PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.
320_ 1	neutral	First, I turned off my cable modem.
125_ 2	positive	The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
209_ 15	neutral	64 kbps is a terrible price to pay.
192_ 16	negative	- Not compatible with Audible.com books.
185_ 6	neutral	The reason why I didn't give the Zen Micro 5 stars is that they also seem to want to conform the the Ipod sense of style.
132_ 356	neutral	  While he's not the most careful guy in the world, it was really beat up consider the minimal amount he uses the thing, and talking to other people who have iPods confirmed that the player scratches very easily- and from personal experience, they look terrible scratched up.
189_ 19	neutral	POSITIVES:  Reasons for getting the Zen Micro instead of the iPod:  1.
6_ 0	positive	This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
283_ 5	negative	So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
287_ 14	neutral	Why they brought this to market is beyond me.
132_ 527	neutral	Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?
178_ 11	neutral	ter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.
0_ 144	positive	I'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera.
0_ 128	neutral	Who knows� maybe the service center did a sloppy job in fixing the camera the first time, that it is easily broken.
1_ 3	negative	The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
134_ 13	neutral	No, of course not.
194_ 17	positive	It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.
17_ 0	negative	I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
227_ 10	neutral	The solution?
73_ 5	positive	(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
169_ 3	neutral	Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .
20_ 1	positive	I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
233_ 12	positive	I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
233_ 5	neutral	Now I'm a techy and like getting technical about things so I'd brief you in on the few features I liked about this phone-
268_ 23	neutral	On average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.
248_ 7	neutral	Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..
166_ 9	neutral	The reason is simple, one word, and "security".
281_ 4	negative	During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
74_ 1	positive	I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
36_ 1	positive	VERY smal.
225_ 48	neutral	If you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.
169_ 14	neutral	There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.
95_ 1	neutral	But just to let you know that I've been breastfeeding and the poop doesn't stink as much as formula poop.
225_ 26	neutral	At least, that is, while it's still alive.
212_ 9	neutral	e again.
3_ 12	negative	This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
0_ 201	positive	Perfect size! Beats the competition by leaps and bounds.
218_ 1	neutral	I wanted something more portable, shirt-pocket sized, and something to complement the new Yahoo Music Unlimited site.
79_ 15	neutral	This will never be a problem with the Champ.
132_ 194	neutral	 I was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.
154_ 1	positive	My experience with installation was quite good.
0_ 28	positive	I did not conduct a rigorous test, but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras, and the Canon won hands down.
132_ 376	neutral	The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.
268_ 3	positive	The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
248_ 0	neutral	I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.
132_ 447	neutral	 I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.
248_ 5	neutral	Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..
179_ 18	positive	Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc.
112_ 0	neutral	My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.
132_ 334	neutral	 I recommend Shures (shure.com).
210_ 3	neutral	I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.
132_ 478	neutral	I Love My iPod!
231_ 4	neutral	Simple.
217_ 27	neutral	Please judge any review you read -- in any medium, be it here or newspapers or magazines -- by its own merits. ****  Fred
132_ 148	neutral	 they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.
111_ 13	negative	Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
294_ 1	negative	It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
5_ 12	negative	4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
115_ 6	negative	I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
194_ 2	positive	It's so small.
274_ 11	neutral	3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
132_ 371	positive	  If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.
0_ 159	neutral	CNET told you not to look for advanced controls.
136_ 15	positive	Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.
298_ 2	negative	Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
194_ 5	positive	The sound is amazing.
255_ 5	neutral	I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.
166_ 17	neutral	Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.
250_ 3	negative	This phone doesn't include Phone card calling.
140_ 5	neutral	Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.
206_ 12	positive	The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense.
189_ 35	neutral	This is what I do:  I copy all the music I want to import to the Zen Micro into an iTunes play list.
138_ 7	neutral	If I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.
139_ 9	neutral	P2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!
214_ 21	neutral	I feel like it's just me and the music and I am transported into a different world.
132_ 210	neutral	 The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.
0_ 219	positive	And the video quality is amazing.
189_ 10	neutral	Bottomline, don't even bother with the software that comes with the Zen Micro.
88_ 3	neutral	As the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.
215_ 10	positive	Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.
291_ 1	neutral	I followed the instructions to the letter.
0_ 180	negative	The only problem I have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don't have a nice click.
79_ 11	positive	2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
132_ 503	neutral	A lot of this has to do with being so excited when you first get it that you get beside yourself and have to force yourself to slow down.  ;)  I love the shuffle function, which virtually eliminates the need to touch it at all.
132_ 379	neutral	  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.
132_ 182	positive	ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.
256_ 9	negative	I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
221_ 2	neutral	I wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.
229_ 11	positive	This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another.
214_ 1	neutral	Of course the first one I decided to research first was the Apple iPod.
179_ 13	neutral	All this took a couple of hours fidling, as I did not go to Linksys website for support - so I wouldn't know if there is help there.
132_ 230	neutral	 I wish I had a long time ago.
173_ 7	negative	The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.
137_ 7	positive	You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.
0_ 73	neutral	I don't miss the high speed program, nor the manual overide, since I had read numerous reviews and specs. before I ordered.
220_ 3	positive	The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.
145_ 0	neutral	I got this inexpensive  router to let me connect two desktops and a Thinkpad laptop to my NTL broadband modem, instead of having to go through the hassle of rebooting the modem and connecting to a different PC, as and when needed.
128_ 12	positive	All in all I am pleased with the router.
308_ 1	positive	While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
223_ 7	neutral	As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.
83_ 4	positive	It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
246_ 8	negative	All in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.
303_ 1	neutral	Not much recourse for the consumer in these cases.
0_ 9	negative	I did see the review here and other places about a cracked LCD screen.
189_ 32	positive	You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.
0_ 91	negative	 battery life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times...the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it's normal.
193_ 43	neutral	My PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.
203_ 1	negative	You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.
125_ 6	positive	I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
122_ 11	positive	What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
132_ 0	neutral	Don't get this...keep browsing.
227_ 13	neutral	3.
179_ 6	negative	Setting up the system was not too complicated.
31_ 16	neutral	I'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.
188_ 12	neutral	you just get used to it after a while.
132_ 227	neutral	 I love my new iPod!
288_ 0	neutral	Antagonising
4_ 1	positive	after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
233_ 0	neutral	Its been 11 months now that I've held on to my Nokia 6600 for.
217_ 8	neutral	The Carbon is nice but offers no improvement to the near-perfect iPod experience.
123_ 1	negative	The depth adjustment was sloppy.
0_ 90	neutral	i just thought it's cute and cool =)
0_ 157	neutral	If you want one you better hurry up - supply is low and demand is high which means prices may go way up!
206_ 10	neutral	My list of "nice to have" features is a little longer, but it also contains nothing unreasonable: backlit screen, removable battery, FM Radio feature, ID3 Tag line support, lots of storage.
193_ 42	neutral	I sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.
321_ 1	negative	This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
243_ 19	neutral	Does all this sound technical?
323_ 0	neutral	I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.
132_ 224	neutral	 I am a total iPod addict.
125_ 9	positive	It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
0_ 97	positive	if you'll only read the whole manual, you'll find out even more cool features and you'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
132_ 502	positive	  The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.
285_ 4	neutral	So, if you have a fairly fast computer (1 gig or better) with plenty of ram (512) and your not gaming online or running streaming video continually, you should be fine.
100_ 4	neutral	Originally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.
169_ 6	neutral	Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.
193_ 34	positive	Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.
207_ 4	neutral	Then last week, my player just quit working, period.
100_ 5	positive	Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
188_ 0	positive	I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.
265_ 3	positive	The interface is simple to use.
146_ 3	neutral	But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.
220_ 11	negative	The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.
132_ 48	neutral	buy it.
227_ 17	negative	Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.
116_ 2	positive	It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
189_ 27	neutral	4.
166_ 26	neutral	Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.
0_ 155	neutral	Highly recommended.
278_ 5	negative	T610 supports only midi files.
180_ 3	negative	The tech support is worthless too.
132_ 180	neutral	For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.
209_ 8	positive	The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds.
214_ 30	neutral	PS.
0_ 54	neutral	Canon is fixing / replacing but 2 to 3 weeks turn around.
132_ 479	neutral	 Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.
132_ 508	neutral	However, I have found that converting my CD's and MP3's into the iTunes library fo!r upload takes a fairly annoying chunck of time.
166_ 23	neutral	Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.
108_ 4	positive	The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
132_ 278	neutral	In the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!
133_ 5	positive	It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.
29_ 3	positive	This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
132_ 39	neutral	God Save Apple  I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.
106_ 10	neutral	Accessories included in the package are: - 1/2" shank, 1/2" diameter, 1" cutting length, 2 carbide flute straight bit - parallel guide - template guide - template adapter for 3rd-party guides - 1/4" chuck sleeve - cutting depth fine adjustment knob (which takes a "13 mm" wrench to install, but a crescent wrench works OK too)
175_ 7	neutral	But if you want to get into networking and running wireless.
136_ 12	neutral	I bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.
33_ 1	negative	If you're looking for a digital camera to replace your big Nikon or Canon SLR, forget it - film is still king when exquisite detail and fine color rendition are critical.
212_ 8	neutral	As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!
201_ 20	positive	There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock.
144_ 4	neutral	Although it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.
132_ 10	neutral	This is really stupid to me. 18 months for a battery isn't good, actually, it's medicore.
36_ 12	positive	5- Excelent software package.
243_ 13	neutral	While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.
183_ 26	neutral	What is up with nickle and dimeing consumers on the recharge cord?
97_ 3	negative	I gave up and got a diaper Dekor.
225_ 66	neutral	Do your research; check !
68_ 6	neutral	It takes regular trash bags.
193_ 28	positive	It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.
225_ 56	neutral	You once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left/right prongs out.
209_ 17	positive	The player is smaller than you think.
319_ 8	negative	There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
132_ 444	positive	The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used.
132_ 452	positive	I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives.
64_ 0	neutral	We just had a baby and were debating getting either this product or the Diaper genie and this is what sold us on this product
136_ 23	neutral	nd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.
166_ 11	neutral	cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.
120_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the price.
218_ 6	neutral	And I gave my CD plyaers away in a garage sale.
195_ 31	positive	Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.
188_ 9	positive	the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.
136_ 21	neutral	So 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.
233_ 15	positive	The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
268_ 18	negative	I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
193_ 29	neutral	 You will find a small folder/envelope on top along with the player.
132_ 390	neutral	 Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.
224_ 10	positive	It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.
132_ 462	neutral	Burning CDs from iTunes is much easier than the Windows Media Player, which I was previously using.
176_ 3	neutral	I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.
100_ 23	neutral	Now when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.
322_ 1	neutral	I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)
101_ 3	neutral	I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.
167_ 0	neutral	I'm using sveasoft's firmware, but search the web for more information about it--you may find you don't approve of the author's tactics, which I only learned about after I'd paid my $20 subscription.
298_ 13	neutral	We'd used Norton products like Internet Security 2003 forever with only rare troubles.
195_ 10	positive	Battery : A Big Big plus.
193_ 51	positive	The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.
306_ 18	neutral	I gave up.
259_ 4	neutral	T-Mobile's minute plans are cheaper for a reason.
168_ 2	negative	I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek.
91_ 13	negative	Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
16_ 0	positive	The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
201_ 23	neutral	The life-span on it, though, is NOT as advertised, but if you're not a heavy user, you can tick in at 9-10 hours of playback.
80_ 6	positive	I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
238_ 2	positive	i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
69_ 3	positive	THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
206_ 20	negative	Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up.
176_ 5	neutral	I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!
132_ 449	neutral	I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!
132_ 62	neutral	I use my iPod all the time.
131_ 15	negative	Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
198_ 1	negative	After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.
132_ 381	neutral	But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.
306_ 12	neutral	I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.
243_ 10	negative	BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
132_ 209	positive	 Battery non-issue.
193_ 45	positive	The interface works great.
72_ 0	positive	I love this product!
132_ 51	neutral	How did we listen to music before it?
93_ 0	positive	This is a GREAT product!
131_ 19	positive	For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
119_ 0	neutral	This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.
135_ 9	neutral	(Didn't find that out until I talked to someone in technical support an hour later.
200_ 0	negative	It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general.
0_ 42	positive	All I have to say is that the pics I get with my SD500 are both rich and color and high in detail, the user interface is awesome, the battery charger is tiny and super light and SD cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time.
150_ 2	positive	It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.
304_ 7	neutral	Avoid like the plague.
159_ 0	negative	It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.
295_ 2	neutral	Maybe it's me, but this isn't my program.
75_ 0	positive	The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
173_ 1	neutral	One device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.
122_ 9	positive	The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
192_ 11	negative	I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.
91_ 12	negative	CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
319_ 5	negative	HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
217_ 14	positive	Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility.
279_ 0	positive	This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.
15_ 10	positive	It fits in your pocket.
182_ 1	positive	what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
323_ 3	positive	I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
205_ 3	neutral	Also, the latest version of the firmware seems to actual deliver (in fact, more than deliver) the 12 hour battery life the specifications claim.
199_ 15	neutral	after they have been loaded into the Zen which is something I've had to do many times already.
0_ 56	positive	I have been very impressed with my purchase of the SD500 I bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it.
214_ 8	neutral	I was going to purchase a pink one and then decided that I'd get a purple one because that's my favorite color....however Circuit City had it for $10 cheaper ($219.00) in black and I could !
0_ 57	positive	The pictures are tack sharp, colors are vivid, and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire.
132_ 242	positive	(It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!
132_ 77	neutral	Very Pleased.
132_ 13	neutral	 However, the Creative and iRiver players are (Rio's isn't), and they only cost around $30 to replace, while iPod charges shipping and technical support.
203_ 4	negative	Screen review could be better.
0_ 153	positive	another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera.
281_ 1	neutral	I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.
193_ 48	positive	What impressed me most was the sound.
0_ 192	positive	I upgraded from a very small 3.2 mpxl camera to this camera with great results.
291_ 2	neutral	But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.
206_ 13	positive	The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it.
135_ 17	neutral	The router comes with a TON of options for setup, but sadly enough, I had no idea what most of it meant.
211_ 27	positive	Pick your favorite color and buy it.
132_ 332	positive	  It all sounds great too.
134_ 5	neutral	After asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is "admin"?) it refused to go past step 8.
299_ 7	neutral	It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.
0_ 142	positive	The flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent.
92_ 1	negative	The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
190_ 20	positive	However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter.
117_ 1	neutral	For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.
136_ 35	neutral	Hope this helps.
108_ 0	neutral	I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.
132_ 489	neutral	If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.
132_ 273	neutral	So, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.
36_ 4	positive	I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.
276_ 8	negative	the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
53_ 3	positive	I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
269_ 0	positive	I really love this phone...
132_ 528	neutral	There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.
117_ 8	positive	I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
176_ 6	neutral	I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!
132_ 377	neutral	Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.
274_ 8	negative	The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.
183_ 9	neutral	But Amazon won't allow me to reduce the number of stars once I have already established three two days ago.
256_ 6	negative	The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
146_ 1	neutral	Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.
0_ 33	neutral	I can't comment on most of the manual features of the camera because I've been shooting in auto mode, but based on my experience so far, manual adjustment, while available, won't be needed for most of the shots I will be taking.
268_ 33	positive	If you use linux and want GRPS and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.
132_ 477	neutral	 I would strongly recommend you get one !!
217_ 19	neutral	Well, if size matters, and you like the idea of a lime-green or bright yellow device, then I'd have to go with a Creative Zen Micro.
283_ 3	negative	Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
185_ 0	neutral	I am one of the many people who (a) are PC Based and (b) can't stand to see the multitudes of people with those funky white headphones that belong to Ipod users.
291_ 6	negative	The customer support is pathetic.
176_ 8	neutral	If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!
1_ 4	negative	I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
15_ 17	neutral	You take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !
132_ 189	neutral	 Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.
147_ 10	neutral	My mistake.
54_ 4	neutral	And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.
0_ 113	positive	I still have my s70 because I like the wider lens sometimes, but in general, if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package, the sd500 is the only one you should buy.
3_ 10	negative	Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
175_ 11	positive	So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html
132_ 83	positive	 The sound is just fine.
225_ 21	neutral	and labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.
222_ 1	positive	This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.
35_ 18	positive	In auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera.
193_ 50	neutral	My hobby is home audio and home theater.
0_ 177	positive	This is overall the best point and shoot camera I've used.
132_ 196	negative	  The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
35_ 0	positive	I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.
217_ 9	neutral	The scroll wheel is not an Apple innovation, but it took Apple to put it on their MP3 player for the obvious to become clear to the industry.
5_ 1	positive	It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
207_ 23	negative	Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.
214_ 26	neutral	I would say the only thing I need to adjust is the sensitivity of the touch pad.

267_ 10	positive	As for bluetooth, no problems at all.
132_ 225	positive	The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
141_ 3	positive	The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
188_ 14	positive	all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.

207_ 7	negative	Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
0_ 189	neutral	For me the colors of the Casio-cameras (Z750, Z50)aren't by far as good as that of the SD500, the pictures looks more artificial and over processed.
0_ 168	positive	Very good "every day" camera. Fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos.
132_ 263	neutral	You can transfer music from one PC to the other.
132_ 110	neutral	Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead  If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.
185_ 3	neutral	(That was a major turn off).
295_ 1	neutral	Had to uninstall it.
212_ 10	positive	Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.
187_ 12	positive	Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.
0_ 167	neutral	If you don't care about manual controls then its for you!
0_ 66	negative	The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures, especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can.
179_ 11	neutral	) as opposed to "gateway", disabled DHCP and gave the router an IP number within the range served by the DHCP service from the modem.
134_ 10	neutral	Stupid me.
207_ 5	negative	After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).
189_ 44	neutral	But if you get that "fuzzy legal feeling" from paying for songs, at least buy them from allofmp3.com, there are no restrictions and the songs cost pennies.
183_ 38	neutral	) I purchased this device primarily to record off the built-in FM receiver for lectures and seminars that are broadcast live over a FM signal for the hearing impaired.
3_ 13	negative	Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
211_ 0	positive	The Zen Micro is near perfect.
210_ 0	neutral	I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.
43_ 2	neutral	We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).
81_ 2	negative	We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
132_ 418	neutral	A lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.
323_ 5	negative	It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
223_ 17	positive	If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.
89_ 0	neutral	I originally put this item on my baby registry because friends of mine highly recommended the use of a diaper pail.
254_ 4	positive	A huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it.
219_ 0	negative	If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while.
110_ 3	neutral	I have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.
257_ 0	neutral	What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)
132_ 154	neutral	I bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.
229_ 2	neutral	) A previous reviewer has mentioned several different issues with the 'Zen Micro'.
313_ 6	positive	The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
301_ 0	negative	I recommended this for my father based on my experience with previous versions.
132_ 1	neutral	The iPod has so far been one of the most advertised and populated MP3 players so far.
132_ 94	positive	Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2"
225_ 25	neutral	Just check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.
175_ 9	neutral	I can't really think of any negatives, but I'll try okay.

31_ 9	positive	They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
132_ 232	negative	As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance.
35_ 4	positive	The lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don't need to fuss with a lens cap.
32_ 3	neutral	This year, with a cruise to Nova Scotia coming in  August, I decided the time was right and just purchased a Canon S100  Digital Elph.
21_ 2	neutral	The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.
193_ 14	neutral	All this before I found out the bad news.
199_ 5	positive	Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.
214_ 9	neutral	pick it up from the store.
243_ 32	neutral	Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.
207_ 19	positive	I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.
290_ 7	positive	I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
65_ 6	negative	I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
309_ 1	negative	When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
224_ 3	negative	(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.
130_ 1	negative	Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
6_ 1	positive	It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
132_ 80	neutral	 The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.
65_ 8	positive	I highly recommend this!
141_ 0	neutral	I was waiting for wireless to be faster then 11mbs.
55_ 3	negative	The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
0_ 88	neutral	shake it a little bit and it'l change the background color. if you've holding the camera horizontally, then it will show the time and date horizontally.
101_ 0	positive	I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
188_ 7	neutral	in principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.
234_ 5	negative	When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
191_ 21	neutral	You have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.
275_ 11	neutral	i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.
195_ 11	positive	Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.
252_ 3	positive	High quality video and pictures rock!
35_ 21	positive	There are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact.
132_ 2	neutral	I'm still figuring out why.
132_ 104	negative	 No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
0_ 146	positive	This camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact, take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot.
132_ 186	positive	All in all, this is a wonderful device.
188_ 10	negative	the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.
36_ 2	neutral	You'll carry it with you every day.
97_ 2	neutral	Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly.
249_ 7	neutral	The ONLY bad thing?
93_ 2	neutral	Not only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?
0_ 36	neutral	This is a common problem with all ultra compacts, but I think I will probably go out and buy an external flash at some point.
132_ 408	negative	First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
265_ 8	positive	On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
132_ 389	neutral	 Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).
140_ 2	neutral	After asking around, I found out I didn't.
132_ 266	neutral	 If you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music/etc. it won't work.
292_ 0	negative	I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
123_ 4	negative	My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
85_ 3	neutral	Only problem.
225_ 44	neutral	Why?
36_ 6	neutral	Fool proof.
298_ 8	neutral	The tests were right.
151_ 2	positive	The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.
9_ 1	positive	It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
0_ 127	negative	I took it out one day and the LCD was not working.
187_ 23	positive	Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.
105_ 0	negative	It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
256_ 13	negative	It would not hang up on calls.
82_ 3	neutral	I second that you just need to fold up the diaper (with wipes inside) neatly, but that is not a big deal.
132_ 57	neutral	 The backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.
46_ 1	neutral	An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.
67_ 9	neutral	Another tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.
222_ 0	neutral	I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.
132_ 188	neutral	  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.
191_ 16	positive	The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.
0_ 204	neutral	Check this one out for yourself for sure!
132_ 221	positive	Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use.
3_ 11	neutral	The longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
268_ 28	negative	However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
98_ 4	positive	I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.
166_ 60	neutral	As said before, you may get some conflicts.
187_ 1	neutral	I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.
132_ 197	positive	  Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.
73_ 4	positive	*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
132_ 365	neutral	 Since no company has yet to come out with an interchangeable battery for the jukebox-sized players (the Creative Labs Zen Micro is the only one I'm aware of that has this, and it's 5 GB), this can be an issue.
136_ 26	positive	Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.
62_ 1	negative	The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
17_ 2	negative	The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
166_ 15	neutral	Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.
120_ 1	neutral	This is my second one.
225_ 33	negative	just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.
169_ 1	neutral	It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.
190_ 7	neutral	The first was an ipod 5gb (I could kick myself for not buying it), and the other was a creative 5gb.
240_ 9	neutral	Is it really slow, or what?
132_ 213	neutral	  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).
169_ 12	neutral	My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.
128_ 9	neutral	After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.
193_ 19	neutral	This is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.
135_ 19	neutral	! and step by step explanations for all the different setup options and their relevance.
89_ 16	negative	Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
132_ 484	neutral	 After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.
0_ 212	neutral	Flash works well for a compact, red eye is a minor problem.
100_ 21	neutral	Remember, it does hold dirty diapers!
280_ 2	negative	But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
54_ 1	neutral	We hated that thing!
268_ 0	positive	This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
187_ 14	positive	It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.
142_ 6	neutral	After countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.
190_ 23	negative	Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs.
129_ 7	neutral	I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.
83_ 0	neutral	She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.
142_ 11	neutral	My ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.
174_ 10	neutral	When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.
176_ 4	positive	Speed is not a problem.
32_ 13	neutral	But otherwise I am thrilled to have taken the plunge into digital  photography.
305_ 0	neutral	Well, I must be one of the few fortunate ones on here.
242_ 8	negative	No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
54_ 11	neutral	No spinning it or anyhting!
287_ 2	negative	For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
243_ 39	negative	In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
33_ 2	neutral	Before you give up on digital cameras, though, ask yourself a few questions:
113_ 1	neutral	She told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.
132_ 248	neutral	 I actually hooked up the iPod to my receivers AUX port with a Pbus connector and a Y-splitter cable, it wasn't too hard to do and now, I can listen to all my music in my car without ever having to lug around CDs again.
132_ 417	neutral	  Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini
40_ 2	positive	because, unless it's small, I won't cary it around.
256_ 14	negative	Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
248_ 1	negative	If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.
132_ 290	neutral	Don't apply the black cushioned protectors.
242_ 28	neutral	This is no small deal.
183_ 10	positive	The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it.
213_ 0	neutral	so i admit it... i wanted a zen micro, because the appeal of the iPod was overshadowed by it's annoying trendy hipster popularity and i felt better about myself for choosing a rip off version of that trendy hipster popularity.
227_ 20	positive	I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it.
179_ 7	neutral	Firstly, I mounted the 7dbi antenna pair, replacing the original ones.
132_ 465	neutral	 The second battery charge lasted over twelve hours.
132_ 131	positive	 I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
0_ 145	neutral	You will not be dissapointed!
281_ 0	neutral	I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.
178_ 10	neutral	Somehow the adap
313_ 5	neutral	My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.
0_ 49	negative	After 57 pictures total the LCD went black except for the icons showing the settings.
4_ 0	neutral	I researched digital cameras for a month before purchasing the s100...
320_ 0	positive	PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
220_ 1	neutral	these are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.
324_ 3	negative	Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
132_ 499	positive	I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.
100_ 14	neutral	He thinks it is magic when the diaper "disappears".
53_ 1	positive	It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
170_ 2	positive	I am getting better speeds on all my web programs.
171_ 1	negative	Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.
258_ 3	neutral	 The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.
80_ 4	positive	I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.
263_ 5	negative	the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
139_ 15	neutral	However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.
228_ 3	neutral	It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.
132_ 238	neutral	 That's the only advice I would give to someone considering an iPod purchase: you really may not really need 20GB or 40GB.
186_ 15	positive	Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.
24_ 0	neutral	My last digital camera was the Canon Powershot A5 Zoom, which I liked  quite a bit.
132_ 36	neutral	At least Creative and iRiver's only charge toll fees like most companies.
320_ 6	neutral	Next I de-fragged my hard drive.
225_ 29	neutral	A trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.
132_ 88	neutral	Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.
21_ 3	positive	But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
136_ 2	positive	Another 5 star performance.
298_ 24	neutral	Unfortunately, you can't buy the corporate edition over the counter.
113_ 2	positive	What an upgrade!!!
119_ 4	positive	I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
90_ 2	negative	I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
31_ 3	positive	First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
0_ 193	positive	Good color and very little needed to correct photos on Paintshop Pro.
32_ 11	positive	I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
0_ 39	neutral	I expected more from a 7MP sensor and a Digic II processor.
98_ 0	neutral	So far so good.
35_ 16	neutral	High-res photos take 1-1.5 MBytes each so you want a CF card sized accordingly.
203_ 3	positive	You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.
221_ 24	neutral	And the price?
128_ 13	positive	The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
324_ 4	neutral	Avoid at all costs
148_ 4	neutral	I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.
129_ 2	neutral	Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.
270_ 0	positive	Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.
132_ 204	negative	Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.
109_ 1	neutral	I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.
127_ 6	negative	Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
233_ 13	positive	3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
195_ 8	negative	The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.
199_ 17	negative	If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.
0_ 213	positive	The camera responce is VERY quick.
181_ 3	neutral	When most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.
89_ 13	neutral	Hello, it does house dirty diapers!!
213_ 19	negative	whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side.
196_ 0	neutral	I can't help but feel peeved by the attitude created by Apple enthusiasts that basically detracts from anything that attempts to compete with Apple products in the marketplace.
115_ 2	positive	I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
71_ 5	positive	Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
242_ 3	neutral	This is representative of the entire phone operation.
241_ 16	negative	You will probably have to get a belt clip for it, however, unless you wear the pants with the cargo pockets.
143_ 6	neutral	I'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.
227_ 1	neutral	However, if you are considering purchasing one to use with subscription music services like Napster-to-go, or Yahoo Music Unlimited, there are a few things to keep in mind:  1.
0_ 69	neutral	But if you want a pocket camera to use when you cant take your Digital SLR with you that will capture quality images this is your choice of camera.
255_ 3	neutral	Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.
273_ 3	negative	There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
183_ 19	negative	You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost.
138_ 6	negative	There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.
193_ 6	neutral	This player is not compatible with Napster To Go.
132_ 457	neutral	Does not come with the dock, remote control, or carrying case like the 3rd generation units - but you get $100 off the price, so you can still end up with the same accessories, and a new generation iPod for the same money.
290_ 10	positive	The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
212_ 15	positive	If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).
195_ 38	neutral	Stuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.
193_ 37	positive	Everything shines of quality.
197_ 7	neutral	No comparison in my opinion.
183_ 8	neutral	This brings my review to one star!
287_ 21	negative	When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
281_ 11	negative	Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
132_ 190	negative	Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!
132_ 208	neutral	 And if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.
148_ 3	neutral	This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.
134_ 9	neutral	I had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.
122_ 1	negative	I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
35_ 17	positive	It's so small and light, even with a spare battery, you really can take it anywhere.
290_ 5	positive	Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
206_ 11	positive	Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more.
225_ 18	positive	Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.
225_ 6	neutral	I saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.
243_ 31	neutral	I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.
7_ 5	positive	Have a great and easy to use bundled software
17_ 3	negative	The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
264_ 1	positive	Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
0_ 78	positive	you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on...literally!
126_ 0	neutral	I reciently purchased this when a 1 1/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.
166_ 18	neutral	What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?
243_ 24	neutral	I followed the technician's directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message "Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer."
213_ 9	neutral	Aren't they something of digital sound experts?
89_ 6	positive	In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
193_ 44	neutral	So the download was much slower.
3_ 15	neutral	Very wrong.
0_ 141	positive	I like to take pictures when I Go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso's but I don't really care that much, i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality.
248_ 8	negative	If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it.
128_ 7	negative	The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
268_ 13	positive	The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
146_ 11	positive	drops and strong signals even from the backyard.
220_ 0	neutral	if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;
207_ 8	neutral	rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.
90_ 1	negative	The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
166_ 48	neutral	You may only have one computer.
233_ 27	neutral	Besides the above mentioned Merits , the phone has decent ear volume and loudspeaker functionality.
215_ 2	neutral	Its $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.
88_ 4	neutral	For the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.
268_ 6	neutral	For the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.
100_ 6	positive	I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
193_ 21	neutral	Its my first purchase choice.
208_ 10	neutral	The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.
195_ 35	neutral	You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.
27_ 1	positive	The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
174_ 7	neutral	Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.
60_ 1	positive	This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
201_ 26	negative	It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music.
132_ 173	positive	 Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.
132_ 509	neutral	  It's the biggest pain in the rear end of all the cons, without a doubt.
211_ 9	positive	The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.
134_ 14	neutral	You have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the "User Guide" tab which loads the manual.
210_ 1	negative	The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.
132_ 93	positive	 Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.
274_ 10	negative	Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.
215_ 7	positive	I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.
290_ 1	neutral	The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.
97_ 6	negative	Don't buy the diaper champ.
32_ 8	positive	I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
246_ 0	positive	I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
228_ 2	neutral	Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.
117_ 7	positive	They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
233_ 18	positive	4. The Build is just right.
322_ 7	positive	I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
312_ 7	negative	What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
229_ 10	neutral	It comes with a built-in program simply entitled 'Creative MediaSource Audio Converter'.
3_ 8	negative	First off, the battery.
132_ 14	neutral	The iPod's battery, 1.5 years.
252_ 5	positive	Bottom line great phone for the time being.
38_ 3	neutral	I love not having to go to Walgreen's to get my pictures develpoed anymore!
193_ 25	neutral	Immediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.
132_ 367	neutral	 Apple is already being outpaced by Creative Labs and Sony on the battery front, and just about any non-Apple player allows you more compatibility with download services than Apple's iTunes-only program.
132_ 240	positive	The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use.
132_ 456	positive	 This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now.
250_ 13	neutral	You have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.
207_ 25	negative	It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.
132_ 323	neutral	  The only thing that protrudes slightly is the "hold" switch.
268_ 5	positive	If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
193_ 23	positive	Don't worry this player rocks.
0_ 116	neutral	As much as I am happy about this great little camera, it is overshadowed by the fact that the LCD is easily spoilt.
273_ 1	negative	These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
183_ 28	neutral	Their product may appear more enconomical, but it isn't in the long run. .
277_ 0	positive	I got this phone yesterday and didn't find any problems with it yet.
163_ 3	neutral	They also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.
318_ 4	positive	On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
108_ 8	neutral	There are a few points of contention which I have.
132_ 61	positive	 Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.
0_ 147	positive	The instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep.
139_ 8	neutral	If you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.
191_ 15	neutral	- Integration with Media Player.
138_ 16	positive	The router works fine for both wired and wireless.
166_ 49	neutral	True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.
139_ 23	neutral	If you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.
136_ 20	neutral	Their are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.
211_ 15	neutral	My ONLY complaint is that when i first received it, it was a little buggy.
124_ 7	positive	I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
256_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.
221_ 5	positive	Sound quality? Phenomenal.
32_ 21	positive	At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
242_ 12	negative	The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
278_ 1	positive	Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!
81_ 5	neutral	This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.
75_ 1	neutral	I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery.
180_ 2	neutral	It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.
211_ 19	neutral	I've programed WMP to throw a few favorites on there all the time and always put my new music (less than 3 months) on so I can listen to them in the gym.
131_ 17	neutral	I am now waiting for this one to stop.
306_ 9	negative	My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
233_ 25	positive	The display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary.
39_ 4	positive	The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.
152_ 2	positive	Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
132_ 326	neutral	  I have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.
185_ 10	neutral	Apple is Apple.
212_ 6	negative	Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.
183_ 13	neutral	Read the next six mixed pros and cons: .
111_ 1	neutral	I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.
195_ 24	positive	Excellent sound I mean the player has juice.
132_ 108	neutral	  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.
93_ 10	neutral	Highly recommended!!!
132_ 471	neutral	 It is sharper on the 'mini' units.
268_ 12	positive	I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
209_ 0	neutral	I would give the Creative Zen Micro five stars without hesitation...except for the eight hours of my life I can never get back.
0_ 23	neutral	These are some shaky ones I took just after delivery:
266_ 7	positive	The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.
153_ 5	positive	Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.
114_ 8	negative	I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
134_ 8	neutral	provide no printed manual.
170_ 3	positive	There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router.
163_ 5	neutral	There may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.
3_ 14	negative	Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
96_ 3	positive	While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.
107_ 4	positive	The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
313_ 11	neutral	Wish I had.
140_ 12	neutral	I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!
139_ 21	neutral	Do not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.
132_ 318	neutral	Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW
223_ 6	positive	Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?
181_ 9	positive	The base was deeper and the highs were crisper.
216_ 1	neutral	After using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.
5_ 6	negative	I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
93_ 7	positive	We've never experienced odor from the pail.
146_ 12	positive	The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.
300_ 1	negative	This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
132_ 378	positive	So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
0_ 84	positive	great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one (Canon A60(?)...the 2.0 megapixel one).
65_ 3	positive	It also holds a lot more diapers.
0_ 224	negative	There were many times when I clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens.
112_ 3	neutral	In the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.
207_ 22	negative	My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.
0_ 21	neutral	I have showed the pictures I have taken to many of my colleagues, alot of whom have expensive dslrs.
241_ 15	positive	I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
99_ 4	positive	Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
170_ 14	negative	The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.
170_ 5	negative	The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys.
243_ 38	neutral	The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.
183_ 27	neutral	Buy from another company and run from Creative, Inc.
0_ 175	positive	if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket, take great pics and video, get the SD500.
274_ 16	neutral	So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.
131_ 8	neutral	Then, without warning, it took off again.
228_ 11	neutral	It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.
79_ 23	positive	Regardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.
256_ 15	positive	Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
58_ 7	neutral	I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.
132_ 185	negative	 Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.
132_ 506	neutral	I love that it allows you to stop and turn it off in the middle of a song if need be, and when you power it back on it will continue right where you left off!
184_ 2	positive	Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.
0_ 197	neutral	Get the Ultra SD card which allows very quick turnaround on shots.
201_ 19	negative	Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.
166_ 13	neutral	In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.
79_ 0	positive	The diaper champ is the best!
116_ 1	positive	For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
298_ 33	negative	Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
39_ 0	positive	The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.
254_ 1	positive	You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
229_ 1	neutral	(The others include: the Intel Pocket Concert, the Archos Jukebox, which was returned after three or four faulty units...I'm extremely patient, and the Creative Labs Nomad Jukebox 3.
189_ 18	negative	This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.
0_ 48	neutral	Never abused.
132_ 167	positive	Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
304_ 9	neutral	For Norton to encourage Spammers by letting them sell their products is a very bad sign.
38_ 2	positive	Very easy to use for someone like me who's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon.
218_ 0	neutral	I already own the Creative Nomad Zen, the 30 gig version.
122_ 10	neutral	The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.
139_ 2	neutral	You will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.
287_ 32	negative	If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
298_ 20	neutral	So, we're fed up.
118_ 0	positive	I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
242_ 13	neutral	I'm not sure that a phone w/ these and all of the above features exists just yet. ...I'm not sure I'd want to spend THAT much time w/ a device, anyhow.
213_ 17	neutral	simple mechanical buttons would probably work !
288_ 2	negative	The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
132_ 207	neutral	  If Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.
259_ 1	negative	They have the worst service of any of the major companies.
276_ 9	neutral	DaveC
202_ 4	neutral	Creative should hire some real industrial designers.
247_ 1	positive	very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
297_ 1	negative	There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
236_ 2	neutral	I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.
132_ 43	positive	I have an ipod and it is a great buy.
41_ 1	neutral	Somehow, the engineers at Canon did it, and the results are nothing less than astounding.
132_ 337	neutral	  I use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.
221_ 4	positive	Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.
241_ 18	positive	I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
280_ 1	neutral	Why is it that I can install any other type of software and it installs and works properly?
150_ 4	neutral	If buying for home office or small business this is a must.
137_ 5	positive	Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.
268_ 17	neutral	Apparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.
191_ 18	neutral	A must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.
234_ 2	negative	On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
190_ 4	neutral	On the other hand, you get terrible sound quality.
99_ 1	positive	This one is really great.
37_ 1	neutral	and i'm glad i did!
136_ 28	neutral	Anyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.
207_ 27	neutral	Those are minor complaints though.
312_ 6	negative	If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
31_ 12	neutral	It requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.
221_ 22	positive	Gets nice sound too.
132_ 220	neutral	 In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.
171_ 2	neutral	When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.
132_ 200	neutral	 However, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.
132_ 518	positive	 Way to go Apple!
233_ 9	positive	Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
15_ 13	neutral	I take my camera everywhere.
307_ 5	neutral	Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.
220_ 4	positive	The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.
185_ 9	neutral	Let's face it.
136_ 19	positive	This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.
132_ 505	neutral	  It charges quickly and holds a charge for a very long time.
14_ 0	neutral	I wrote another review and this is the update.
306_ 19	negative	Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
35_ 6	neutral	Turn-on to ready-to-shoot is about 3 seconds.
263_ 10	neutral	I have used this wireless internet almost everywhere i travel and it works great.
28_ 0	neutral	Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.
189_ 11	negative	NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.
217_ 15	neutral	This makes the Zen Micro the first choice for MP3 owners with a Windows-based system.
315_ 4	positive	This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
115_ 3	negative	That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
0_ 50	neutral	LCD works fine for reviewing images already on the card so it, the LCD, still works, however the camera will not allow new pictures to be taken.
193_ 20	neutral	To bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.
305_ 3	neutral	Sorry to hear about all the other folk's problems....makes me wonder why I'm NOT having any (I'm running Win XP as well).
132_ 421	neutral	I'm glad I did.
189_ 25	neutral	3.
142_ 8	positive	I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!
114_ 0	positive	I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
191_ 12	positive	The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.
119_ 8	positive	Enjoy.
225_ 17	negative	The included headphones suck, so get your own.
220_ 7	neutral	instead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.
233_ 34	negative	Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
213_ 24	negative	-User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website.
106_ 4	neutral	I bobbled a bit at the end of a couple of the cuts because the momentum of the charging M12V was a bit more than I was prepared for.
135_ 16	neutral	meone would just give me some instructions in plain English.
80_ 1	neutral	dirty diapes and soaked diapers.
132_ 480	neutral	I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.
0_ 30	neutral	More detail. More natural color.
209_ 9	neutral	That said, you can get more of what the Zen is capable of by donating them to your local iPod person (they're white) and getting a pair of $60-$80 aftermarket headphones.
126_ 3	positive	If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
233_ 22	positive	This isn't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play aeroplane with this,are you.
75_ 5	positive	Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
156_ 1	positive	I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.
58_ 5	positive	3. It never smelled - at all.
138_ 13	neutral	There was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.
192_ 1	neutral	I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.
298_ 10	negative	Norton support is completely pathetic.
152_ 3	neutral	Then this is the way to go.
74_ 2	negative	The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
132_ 308	neutral	  Cons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.
35_ 9	negative	The auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds.
89_ 2	negative	 Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
132_ 276	neutral	 If this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!
220_ 14	negative	Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.
113_ 0	neutral	This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1/4" fixed base router.
42_ 0	neutral	I was a little skeptical about what people had said about this camera, because it's just so small.
214_ 32	neutral	:-)  www.zetazen.com
221_ 19	neutral	They've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.
279_ 5	positive	Its nice look is also a plus.
135_ 13	neutral	It's like they want to pretend that Apple doesn't exist or something.
136_ 11	neutral	The CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.
189_ 34	positive	I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).
195_ 40	neutral	Spare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.
139_ 12	neutral	Because of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.
0_ 207	positive	I am impressed with this camera inside and out.
228_ 8	positive	The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.
132_ 259	positive	  However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.
287_ 13	negative	I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
132_ 448	neutral	Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.
132_ 41	positive	The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.
268_ 10	neutral	Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
0_ 0	positive	We really enjoyed shooting with the Canon PowerShot SD500.
0_ 176	neutral	Also make sure you pick up a good high speed SD card like the SanDisk Ultra 2.
301_ 1	neutral	I wish I'd done some research first....
256_ 16	neutral	But beware of the bugs; they are major!
132_ 11	neutral	iRiver's battery lasts four to five years.
139_ 11	neutral	On the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.
137_ 10	neutral	Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !
101_ 4	negative	The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
263_ 2	positive	but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
142_ 4	neutral	I wrongly thought that it was the router.
169_ 5	positive	To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.
218_ 5	positive	Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore.
322_ 2	negative	I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
192_ 17	negative	Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.
147_ 9	neutral	I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.
154_ 5	neutral	The whole process was probably about 10 minutes.
138_ 5	neutral	So I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s/w did not recognize it.
318_ 5	positive	It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
132_ 493	neutral	 I set my sights on this super sexy iPod and didn't stop until I finally had one in my hands.
131_ 4	neutral	Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.
221_ 6	positive	unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.
132_ 90	neutral	 I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.
132_ 150	neutral	 a week passed but it was never picked up.
225_ 9	neutral	You can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.
32_ 22	positive	It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
30_ 2	positive	I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
7_ 0	neutral	I have used many digital cameras.
116_ 6	positive	The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
243_ 33	neutral	Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.
306_ 10	neutral	After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.
132_ 394	neutral	  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.
106_ 3	neutral	Hitachi includes a 1/2" straight cutting bit in the package, and I used this to cut out my table.
176_ 9	positive	As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.
29_ 0	positive	I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
58_ 6	neutral	Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.
0_ 70	positive	Glad to see the Ed. revised the previous statements regarding image quality.
170_ 19	negative	Cons. 1. Configuration is not easy as it made out to be 2.Lousy Initial Software 3. Does not work with BitSpirit with UPnP, Besides that its an excellent choice , If you know your way around network configuration go for it.
136_ 7	positive	This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.
249_ 3	positive	I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
252_ 2	positive	It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
178_ 5	neutral	Though admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.
252_ 0	neutral	I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.
132_ 25	positive	  EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
87_ 2	positive	I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
129_ 10	positive	Overall it is a great value.
132_ 96	neutral	12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.
28_ 5	neutral	End of story.
131_ 20	negative	If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
191_ 25	negative	The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
132_ 237	neutral	Perhaps over time I will fill it up, but with almost 250 songs on my iPod now and less than 1GB used, I have a long way to go.
189_ 31	neutral	5.
306_ 4	neutral	The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.
67_ 2	positive	The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
170_ 0	positive	A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality.
132_ 72	neutral	 However, you should still buy an iPod!
0_ 51	neutral	Tried multiple cards both fast and slow speeds and different batteries.
89_ 11	neutral	Also, making sure that the tape on the diapers is secure will prevent that from happening as well.
68_ 2	neutral	It was such a pain to use.
125_ 8	positive	I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
132_ 31	neutral	 BATTERY LIFE: Pretty medicore at 12 hours, the Creative, iAudio, Rio, and iRiver players last longer.
60_ 0	neutral	A MUST HAVE!
197_ 6	neutral	Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.
289_ 1	negative	Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
0_ 24	positive	 I went out and got the Canon today.
111_ 10	negative	1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
243_ 9	neutral	So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.
242_ 7	positive	APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
35_ 8	negative	For example, in auto mode you can't use the flash redeye reduction, you must be in manual mode for that.
108_ 13	negative	Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
276_ 0	neutral	went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.
307_ 13	neutral	And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.
274_ 4	positive	2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.
32_ 7	positive	Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
89_ 7	neutral	For those who are experiencing odor problems, here are some suggestions which should solve the problem:
72_ 2	positive	Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
307_ 9	negative	But those 2 come up every time.
103_ 7	negative	Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
132_ 181	neutral	 PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.
174_ 1	neutral	And provides near zero-statistics.
54_ 10	neutral	There is also no trick to it.
205_ 5	positive	I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors.
172_ 0	positive	Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.
79_ 6	neutral	You had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.
144_ 11	positive	anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.
135_ 4	negative	HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup.
139_ 25	positive	I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.
248_ 4	negative	The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
132_ 74	positive	  Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.
277_ 2	positive	Love the speaker phone.
132_ 460	neutral	   Backing up your iTunes library takes a short amount of time.
25_ 2	positive	The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
291_ 0	neutral	I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.
281_ 7	negative	I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
67_ 5	negative	But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
132_ 152	neutral	buyers BEWARE!
183_ 44	negative	As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.
179_ 4	positive	When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage.
132_ 56	neutral	It allows fast and easy navigation.
225_ 38	neutral	I loved this thing.
100_ 25	positive	5.  The price is right.
77_ 0	positive	I think it's great.
23_ 3	neutral	In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.
112_ 5	positive	On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
189_ 8	negative	The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
225_ 12	neutral	00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).
105_ 2	negative	I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
217_ 6	neutral	What compels you to choose one over the other?
107_ 12	neutral	However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.
72_ 1	positive	With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
183_ 31	negative	The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case.
132_ 63	neutral	 You can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.
166_ 68	neutral	less secure.
132_ 382	neutral	 It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.
0_ 72	neutral	I can accept a little purple fringing on the ocassional difficult shot.
132_ 47	neutral	 the 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.
201_ 18	neutral	I actually prefer the vertical strip rather than running my thumb in continuous circular motion.
132_ 257	neutral	However I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).
243_ 28	neutral	After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.
191_ 13	positive	- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.
191_ 24	positive	I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.
91_ 14	negative	Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.
236_ 0	neutral	Don't get me wrong.
276_ 2	positive	speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !
0_ 18	negative	Some more manual control would have been nice.
132_ 500	positive	The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing.
195_ 30	positive	Its compact and has rounded edges.
99_ 8	positive	We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
54_ 2	neutral	The "new" design still needs lots of improvement!
276_ 7	negative	a bit dissapoitnd on that!
178_ 16	neutral	Anyway, after learning that the "Speedboost" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).
59_ 2	negative	It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
240_ 8	neutral	What's wrong with it?
91_ 7	negative	Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
132_ 307	positive	  20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
80_ 7	positive	This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
166_ 37	neutral	You are really the ones that need this the most.
88_ 1	positive	It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
212_ 5	negative	After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).
11_ 3	positive	Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
242_ 51	negative	When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
68_ 7	neutral	I generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.
196_ 14	positive	Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
107_ 8	positive	The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
196_ 16	negative	P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.
194_ 3	positive	It looks sleek and modern.
93_ 6	positive	We use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.
35_ 7	negative	I'd give it  5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes.
190_ 29	neutral	If you're an audiophile, you already know that mp3 players are far from impressive.
149_ 0	neutral	I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.
195_ 5	positive	User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.
224_ 6	negative	I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.
220_ 17	neutral	To use a bas!
306_ 0	neutral	I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad/pop-up blocking feature along w/the logs on internet usage.
311_ 15	neutral	Detractors should spend more time actually customizing the program to meet their needs instead of being lazy & complaining just for the hell of it.
87_ 1	positive	It works great.
132_ 158	negative	The Battery does not last 12 hours.
134_ 11	neutral	It turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.
213_ 2	neutral	I mainly only get to listen to music in my car, so it's an awesome replacement for a console full of the same ten cd's that have been in there for the last 8 months that i keep forgetting to replace.
0_ 154	positive	Moreover, apart from the plastic cable cover, the camera has a nice, solid feel about it, and it's so tiny, I take it with me wherever I go.
195_ 17	positive	Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.
146_ 7	positive	The setup was very easy.
268_ 29	negative	Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
132_ 443	neutral	 Is extremely senstive to bumps and knocks.
0_ 162	positive	The SD500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed.
103_ 1	positive	But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
267_ 5	positive	5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.
153_ 4	neutral	If you are sharing a cable modem or DSL, it's probably not going to be noticeable.
196_ 4	neutral	_  About the hype:  I must applaud Creative for their restraint.
173_ 5	neutral	After pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.
228_ 4	neutral	What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?
174_ 16	neutral	Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.
79_ 12	positive	You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.
0_ 163	positive	Bottom line, this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck!
132_ 171	neutral	This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y
216_ 3	neutral	This is by far my biggest complaint.
275_ 3	negative	so, right out of the box i had issue.
190_ 9	neutral	So that's the one I bought.
136_ 13	neutral	Within 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.
136_ 33	neutral	Follow the directions exactly.
255_ 0	neutral	I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.
71_ 9	positive	This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
307_ 1	negative	Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
125_ 0	neutral	I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.
142_ 2	neutral	I recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.
213_ 6	positive	+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
132_ 292	neutral	 Just kidding.
166_ 40	neutral	Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?
58_ 1	neutral	We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.
189_ 1	neutral	If you're not computer savvy or if you want things as simple as they can be, get the iPod.
3_ 25	negative	it's not my first choice in cameras,
279_ 1	positive	Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.
108_ 3	positive	The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
132_ 18	negative	 Also, not liking the gel case.
132_ 184	neutral	Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.
296_ 1	negative	Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
304_ 3	positive	Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
227_ 15	neutral	However, once an album is playing, there's no gap between songs.
312_ 0	negative	I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
79_ 1	neutral	Having used it with 2 children 13 months apart.
32_ 20	neutral	I've found I can get  from nine to twelve compressed 1600 X 1200 photos on one 8MB card, or 28  images uploaded from my PC.
132_ 101	positive	Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.
300_ 0	negative	Before installing anything on your computer, you need to do a bit of research before spending the money.
215_ 3	neutral	You can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.
70_ 2	positive	It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
274_ 0	neutral	I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.
287_ 3	neutral	Something happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for "Internet Security 2004".
287_ 1	negative	This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
214_ 4	neutral	So I went to www.playforsure.com to see what devices were compatible with various downloading services.
312_ 2	neutral	It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.
138_ 2	neutral	The new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.
205_ 17	positive	So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own.
105_ 4	neutral	Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.
132_ 174	positive	There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
287_ 27	negative	But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
132_ 126	neutral	  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.
132_ 113	neutral	 I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.
111_ 5	positive	Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
198_ 3	neutral	I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.
210_ 6	neutral	Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?
154_ 4	neutral	The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.
154_ 11	positive	The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.
29_ 2	neutral	I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.
139_ 0	neutral	Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.
3_ 26	positive	I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
211_ 7	neutral	All of my files are mp3 or wma, Windows Media Player is my primary music suite, i use it to burn, play, rip, and sync.
164_ 0	neutral	This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.
224_ 8	negative	I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.
193_ 56	positive	The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.
139_ 7	neutral	With a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.
191_ 30	positive	If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.
215_ 6	positive	I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.
111_ 12	negative	I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
175_ 2	positive	No down time, great signal strength.
210_ 5	negative	Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.
181_ 6	neutral	I don't care what ELSE it can do.
243_ 7	neutral	In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.
0_ 158	neutral	The CNET review does not give this camera the review it deserves.
205_ 16	positive	The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great.
131_ 16	negative	The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
285_ 1	positive	Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
132_ 121	neutral	And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.
178_ 1	neutral	For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.
221_ 23	positive	The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.
191_ 23	positive	With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.
278_ 9	neutral	I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.
208_ 8	neutral	I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.
175_ 10	neutral	Nothing came to mind.
212_ 13	positive	The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).
238_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone last march, almost a year ago, in saudi arabia (it came out there before it did here).
212_ 11	neutral	They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.
190_ 16	negative	The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having.
302_ 3	positive	The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
221_ 12	positive	Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.
73_ 0	positive	and we still LOVE it!
169_ 4	positive	The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.
144_ 9	positive	In addition it is very easy to setup.
100_ 7	positive	1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
109_ 0	positive	This is an excellent router for the money.
0_ 198	neutral	To limit lag time, turn off flash or if flash needed, turn off display.
70_ 1	positive	It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
206_ 4	neutral	To me, the key elements that must be present in an MP3 player are as follows:  -Fast transference of songs to player -Well-designed computer-side interface -Easy menu navigation and well-designed control scheme -Good sound (duh) -Reasonable battery time (~6 Hours)  That's it?
132_ 105	positive	. iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.
190_ 17	neutral	They didn't really make any difference.
187_ 13	positive	The hardcase they give with it must work well.
129_ 8	neutral	I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.
146_ 14	positive	The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.
323_ 4	neutral	I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.
186_ 14	positive	The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.
274_ 3	positive	The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.
107_ 0	positive	This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
178_ 7	neutral	The documentation was just horrible.
268_ 25	positive	I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
265_ 9	positive	Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
132_ 44	neutral	It holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.
254_ 3	positive	Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.
302_ 1	neutral	Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
263_ 0	neutral	I used to work with t-mobile..
290_ 6	neutral	It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.
242_ 22	positive	Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
86_ 3	negative	All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
132_ 123	neutral	Still not so sure about this one...
209_ 27	neutral	You may need to briefly disable various spam blockers, cookie swatters, and antivirus programs (I know, I know -- get offline first).
189_ 23	neutral	 2.
298_ 1	negative	From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
73_ 2	neutral	We opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.
168_ 8	positive	If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.
157_ 1	neutral	In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.
249_ 1	neutral	One minute with the salesman and I was sold.
183_ 37	neutral	5.
231_ 6	positive	This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
184_ 5	positive	Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.
43_ 1	positive	The size is tiny, which I love.
189_ 13	neutral	Set the sensitivity of the touch pad to LOW.
243_ 30	neutral	All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.
215_ 13	positive	An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.
0_ 95	neutral	but it's good enough since i upload them to the computer anyway (and sound is good too once you view it on the computer/tv).
241_ 6	neutral	2) Camera phone.
114_ 2	positive	It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
97_ 7	neutral	You will be sorry after a few months.
148_ 2	positive	I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.
171_ 4	negative	Stay away from this junk.
155_ 2	neutral	If you want "the newest gadget" get the one with speedbooster.
274_ 12	neutral	Looks big in the display ads though.
132_ 163	negative	My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
0_ 114	positive	I love the rounded edges now, fits so much better in a pocket, jeans or suit.
174_ 12	neutral	ID on their router.
287_ 39	negative	The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
144_ 10	neutral	I w!
210_ 2	negative	After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.
225_ 13	neutral	When mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.
0_ 182	positive	I also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact PS cameras since it's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot.
240_ 6	negative	I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
311_ 7	negative	They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
225_ 0	positive	The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.
0_ 123	neutral	Treating my cameras, past and present, with utmost care ensures my investment.
260_ 3	negative	T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
183_ 5	neutral	I just tried to move a load of plain data files from my home computer to my office work computer, and it is promting me to install Zen Micro software, etc....
88_ 5	neutral	Now that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.
212_ 19	neutral	Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )
325_ 0	neutral	I have been a loyal Norton Anti-Virus and Internet Security software user for as long as I can remember.
241_ 13	neutral	This is great for putting photos and memos on the computer and transferring calander data to my phone.
291_ 3	negative	Stay away from this product!
273_ 4	negative	Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.
74_ 0	positive	It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
214_ 23	neutral	So I can't wait to get on my treadmill with it.
171_ 5	neutral	Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink.
132_ 142	neutral	 i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.
154_ 0	neutral	This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.
132_ 316	neutral	.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.
41_ 0	neutral	My first impression of Elph S100 was that there couldn't POSSIBLY be room in the thing for anything other than a battery and a memory card.
32_ 19	neutral	As other reviews have noted, you will  definitely want one or more additional memory cards.
132_ 231	positive	 The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out.
275_ 0	neutral	my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.
132_ 352	neutral	 I'm not one of them.
233_ 6	positive	1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
116_ 5	positive	Smooth plunging mechanism.
63_ 0	neutral	This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
242_ 11	positive	The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
25_ 9	positive	The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
287_ 36	negative	As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
208_ 11	negative	On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
318_ 3	positive	I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
211_ 17	neutral	over and over again.
122_ 8	positive	The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
142_ 5	neutral	Fool that I was!
132_ 366	neutral	IN SUMMARY: This is a good, basic player.  It's not for everyone, and if you're in the market for one I suggest that you try to put aside the huge popularity of the iPod and look harshly at the actual features that the other players on the market have, and see how they stack up.
132_ 285	neutral	 The list is endless.
268_ 22	neutral	I'm used to having to restart things.
60_ 2	neutral	The one thing that sets this product apart from the diaper genie is that this product can use regular garbage bags.
255_ 6	neutral	I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.
278_ 3	positive	you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.
195_ 26	neutral	The player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).
60_ 6	neutral	FANTASTIC!
132_ 202	neutral	 This type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.
132_ 476	neutral	 Talk about convenience.
223_ 2	positive	I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.
298_ 29	neutral	I'll update my review if I find out otherwise.
287_ 8	neutral	Well, no more.
302_ 2	positive	Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
209_ 11	neutral	ts with Sennheiser HD-497 phones.
151_ 6	positive	Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.
134_ 2	neutral	I know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.
15_ 8	negative	The digital zoom is crap.
206_ 18	negative	00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks.
299_ 0	neutral	I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.
265_ 12	positive	For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
287_ 20	negative	First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
132_ 252	neutral	Regardless though, it did set me back financially but now, I'm glad I have one.
132_ 387	neutral	Just don't drop it.
132_ 405	neutral	But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.
132_ 392	neutral	  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.
188_ 11	positive	i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.
123_ 8	negative	All in all, not very good.
275_ 10	positive	if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.
213_ 3	neutral	she also got me an iRiver FM modulator that plugs into the ligher outlet, so i can play it through my regular radio.
163_ 2	neutral	They've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.
176_ 0	positive	Absolutely no problems with this router.
181_ 4	negative	SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
284_ 0	negative	Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
132_ 440	negative	  Cons Breaks easily.
195_ 18	positive	FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.
174_ 22	neutral	Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.
243_ 26	neutral	I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.
100_ 3	positive	In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
114_ 14	neutral	I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.
225_ 36	positive	One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).
242_ 47	positive	A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
242_ 42	negative	IMP: Two important pieces of advice - Visit Nokia's site.
267_ 9	positive	Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!
232_ 3	positive	This one is full of features(has bluetooth).
132_ 427	neutral	 For about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an "extended warranty" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.
163_ 1	neutral	Cisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.
58_ 3	positive	1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
35_ 15	neutral	Buy at least two batteries and you'll never run out in the field.
3_ 22	negative	To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
196_ 13	positive	Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
166_ 20	neutral	A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.
106_ 16	negative	Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
0_ 129	negative	Although the SD500 takes great quality photos, the sensitivity of the LCD compromises the quality overall.
194_ 13	positive	The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use.
169_ 9	neutral	This is my first foray in!
146_ 0	neutral	I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.
147_ 11	neutral	I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.
209_ 13	neutral	An aside about sound quality: You can have good sound or 2,000+ songs, not both.
132_ 391	neutral	Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.
265_ 1	negative	I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
191_ 1	positive	While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.
279_ 6	positive	And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.
93_ 4	neutral	I couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, "Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?"
0_ 119	neutral	I am still waiting news as to whether I will be charged for the 2nd time.
105_ 6	neutral	Happy woodworking!!
223_ 8	neutral	I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.
132_ 453	neutral	It was worth the wait.
134_ 17	neutral	I don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.
289_ 4	neutral	I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.
174_ 2	neutral	SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.
31_ 1	neutral	price[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.
5_ 7	negative	Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
121_ 0	positive	This is a well-made and powerful tool.
268_ 14	positive	Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
196_ 8	neutral	The result, while naturally encompassing the acquisition of greater market share, is a mediocre product that stands out sorely in terms of quality and value when compared in a virtual vacuum to its competitors.
233_ 4	positive	It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
249_ 5	neutral	I could go on and on---but I won't!
311_ 13	neutral	While I understand the complaints about Symantec's Norton SystemWorks software suite (which are totally justified), the same can't be said for Norton Internet Security.
15_ 5	negative	The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
209_ 2	neutral	Why, troubleshooting, mediating software conflicts, devising workarounds, and when things got too bizarre, even calling tech support.
124_ 3	neutral	The Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.
290_ 0	neutral	I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.
164_ 1	negative	I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.
102_ 0	neutral	I did my homework before buying my larger 3+hp router for my router table.
211_ 6	neutral	I've never owned an Ipod, so this won't be a which one is better review.
147_ 5	neutral	All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.
215_ 15	positive	BUY THE ZEN!"
132_ 249	positive	 And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
87_ 0	positive	I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
246_ 2	negative	You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
275_ 4	negative	namely, it wouldnt sync.
0_ 31	positive	The Canon is very small, definitely pocket size, but still easy to hold firmly.
275_ 5	negative	after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.
248_ 2	negative	This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
173_ 6	positive	Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.
241_ 7	positive	A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
132_ 272	neutral	I had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.
287_ 18	neutral	To say that it is "buggy" would be the world's most profound understatement.
85_ 5	negative	The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
3_ 24	neutral	These are all the flaws I found in the camera,
3_ 6	positive	The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
15_ 12	neutral	But that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.
253_ 8	positive	In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
104_ 2	neutral	I have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.
79_ 4	positive	1) The champ is easy to use.
0_ 130	neutral	I read all the reviews on cnet, steve's, dpreview and a host of other sites before i decided to buy this camera.
68_ 9	positive	If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
60_ 4	negative	The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
298_ 21	negative	DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
138_ 4	neutral	And the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.
206_ 8	neutral	Slow file transfers, menus that take ages to cycle through, and poor battery life plague many of the!
175_ 0	neutral	I've had this Linksys router.
299_ 15	neutral	I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.
291_ 5	neutral	Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.
132_ 393	neutral	  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.
120_ 2	positive	The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.

165_ 2	positive	My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic.
153_ 2	positive	The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients.
154_ 2	positive	I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).
23_ 1	positive	I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
140_ 10	positive	Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.
168_ 3	neutral	I tried to set my IP address and subnet mask and who knows what else.
56_ 1	positive	it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
71_ 7	negative	As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
310_ 2	positive	Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
193_ 5	neutral	The player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.
107_ 13	positive	This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
54_ 5	neutral	As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.
70_ 3	positive	It's also easy to empty out.
147_ 0	positive	I got it working fast enough.
71_ 3	positive	Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
233_ 1	negative	I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
233_ 33	neutral	I wouldn't do that because it's not worth my life.
3_ 1	positive	It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
198_ 5	neutral	I'm less than satisfied.
117_ 5	positive	The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
210_ 8	negative	his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?
298_ 28	negative	Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
132_ 413	neutral	  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.
148_ 0	neutral	I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.
132_ 398	neutral	I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.
111_ 7	neutral	I use custom side clamps set up for 1/4 and 1/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).
66_ 5	neutral	I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.
79_ 9	positive	It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
129_ 9	negative	The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
195_ 37	neutral	Creative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).
106_ 8	positive	The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
304_ 0	positive	I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
7_ 3	positive	Hate to wait between shots
296_ 4	negative	So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
249_ 2	positive	This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
270_ 6	negative	The only problem is the size of the keys.
203_ 2	neutral	Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.
263_ 8	positive	i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
132_ 24	neutral	 There is an alarm and timer, but most MP3 players have this feature.
149_ 5	neutral	Very disappointing.
175_ 6	negative	Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.
97_ 0	negative	Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore.
100_ 8	positive	We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.
233_ 37	negative	You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
132_ 406	negative	 We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
221_ 14	neutral	)  Construction?
128_ 1	neutral	It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.
132_ 438	positive	 They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
132_ 161	negative	 You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
132_ 75	neutral	I had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.
166_ 38	neutral	Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.
132_ 160	neutral	  It seems to deteriorate every time I use it.
0_ 208	neutral	This is my third digital Elph and it is definitley the best ever.
307_ 6	neutral	I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.
275_ 8	neutral	i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.
217_ 4	neutral	At this point, the Rio Carbon is 5Gb (along with a host of South Korean manufacturers), and eventually the iPod will get a "free" upgrade to 5Gb as the 4Gb trickle down to nothing.
204_ 7	negative	The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "enter" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.
200_ 3	negative	It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.
224_ 5	neutral	Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!
183_ 24	neutral	If you want a wall-socket recharging cord, you have to dish out somewhere between $30 and $35, plus shipping and handling, for a cord that cost less than $1 to manufacture and market.
131_ 13	negative	You must keep double checking depths.
181_ 5	negative	Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
166_ 44	positive	ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.
137_ 1	neutral	Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.
225_ 32	neutral	The features this thing has are !
38_ 0	positive	I was looking for something that wasn't too complicated to use and to help the pics I post on Ebay show more detial.
189_ 33	neutral	Now, about the iTunes.
114_ 10	negative	I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
132_ 281	positive	The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
166_ 12	neutral	They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.
166_ 25	neutral	Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.
209_ 24	neutral	2.
25_ 8	positive	Other than that, I love this camera.
0_ 118	neutral	The first time, I paid $165 (excluding shipping) to have it fixed by Canon Service Center.
240_ 0	positive	This one has a good looking.
0_ 226	neutral	Huh? I missed out on lots of photos and lots and lots came back blurry.
188_ 2	negative	HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.
299_ 2	negative	I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
216_ 4	negative	Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.
143_ 2	neutral	Make sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.
132_ 386	neutral	I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.
190_ 3	neutral	On the one hand, you have the ability to store and plays over 1000 songs on one little piece of machine.
132_ 40	neutral	Since then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.
22_ 1	positive	A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
162_ 4	neutral	Haven't had any of the issues I've been reading in the other reviews.
250_ 7	neutral	All you need to do is to choose your "phone card" contact and then "send touch tone" and choose the contact.
169_ 13	positive	In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.
194_ 1	positive	I absolutely love it.
183_ 20	neutral	If you want to recharge it, you MUST connect it to your computer.
287_ 42	neutral	They use to be so useful and neceesary.
250_ 6	neutral	For phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.
201_ 0	neutral	After heavy duty research and reading reviews, I decided to plunge into the MP3 player circus and got myself the Zen Micro.
132_ 529	neutral	 However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.
93_ 3	neutral	I mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.
106_ 13	neutral	Lefties can switch the angle of the handles by loosening the screws, repositioning, then retightening.
191_ 22	neutral	- Doubles as a removable disk drive.
34_ 1	positive	Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
132_ 69	positive	Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.
208_ 13	negative	Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.
225_ 8	positive	It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.
162_ 6	neutral	Before I had to manually put my IP settings into my laptop every time I switched networks.
201_ 2	neutral	I have my reasons.
111_ 14	neutral	2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1/4 inch counterparts.
132_ 17	neutral	 While all MP3 players are easy to scratch, the iPod is the worst of the Creative and iRiver.
187_ 2	positive	1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.
182_ 2	neutral	i got 6000 mp3's you'll never register or gay up.
206_ 21	neutral	These are limited to the voice recorder, address book, and such.
5_ 11	neutral	(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).
135_ 26	neutral	Just make sure to budget a couple of hours for setup, and invite some computer-savvy friends over first if you're prone to high blood pressure.
270_ 17	positive	I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
220_ 2	positive	On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
71_ 11	neutral	It's certainly not worth the money or the upkeep.
140_ 11	negative	Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.
54_ 14	positive	We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
170_ 11	neutral	4 was much more easier to setup but had slower speeds and not as configurable as this.
186_ 16	positive	It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.
88_ 7	positive	It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
193_ 32	neutral	It has Apple insipid written all over it.
163_ 4	neutral	Interestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.
199_ 3	positive	The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me.
205_ 18	positive	They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers.
298_ 31	positive	By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
170_ 6	neutral	VERY IMP.
132_ 16	negative	 Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
0_ 205	neutral	I have not been this happy about a purchase I have made in a long time.
258_ 1	negative	But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.
287_ 12	negative	Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
48_ 0	neutral	Positives:
217_ 1	neutral	The hook with this MP3 player, distinguishing it from the others, is clearly going to be the OS applications it provides.
192_ 5	positive	- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.
312_ 1	negative	If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
289_ 5	neutral	Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)
241_ 11	positive	If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
189_ 29	neutral	The photos don't do it justice.
276_ 3	positive	putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.
250_ 8	neutral	This feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.
132_ 396	neutral	 I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets "stuck," meaning either it won't respond at all, or it "jumps" down playlists uncontrollably.
132_ 411	neutral	 And I'm really not that rough with things!
0_ 132	positive	I tell you now, after lot of shooting in many different situations, this camera is amazing.
243_ 11	neutral	THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.
272_ 4	negative	The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
0_ 96	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.
266_ 6	negative	If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.
274_ 2	neutral	So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.
143_ 1	positive	It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.
0_ 122	neutral	$500 may not be a lot of money for some, but it is for me.
193_ 39	neutral	First I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.
59_ 1	negative	Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
0_ 37	neutral	A few of my indoor shots could have benefited from a stronger flash, but even those shots were not all that bad.
132_ 395	neutral	 Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).
43_ 0	positive	I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.
0_ 81	positive	great picture quality - in automatic mode, quality is great.
55_ 5	negative	My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
166_ 62	neutral	You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.
290_ 2	neutral	This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.
132_ 128	neutral	  Again, another hassle.
189_ 41	neutral	* Of Course, if you've BOUGHT tracks from iTunes, this won't work.
132_ 372	neutral	If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.
19_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
311_ 1	neutral	I was forced to re-format the next day due to extensive incapatability issues.
313_ 9	neutral	Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.
108_ 1	neutral	The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.
272_ 1	positive	I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
0_ 214	neutral	Almost no lag between button activation and shutter.
241_ 5	positive	Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
71_ 8	positive	But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
140_ 3	neutral	The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.
196_ 9	positive	About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
209_ 14	neutral	You're better off not dropping below 128 kbps, especially with music.
132_ 226	neutral	 I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.
213_ 12	neutral	before i get into the cons, i'll make a note about the scrollpad.
174_ 4	neutral	If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.
187_ 0	positive	I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.
100_ 13	positive	The Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.
32_ 5	positive	First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
241_ 10	positive	4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
243_ 5	neutral	Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.
132_ 355	negative	The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
0_ 140	neutral	In good light and low light the things a champ.
3_ 0	positive	I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
135_ 1	positive	I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself.
200_ 4	negative	If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.
0_ 7	neutral	I post under JTL at dcresource...check out my images if you want to see what this camera can do.
183_ 7	negative	Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
319_ 6	negative	It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
132_ 435	positive	 Really easy to use.
306_ 1	negative	I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
140_ 1	neutral	The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the "Speedbooster" version.
287_ 31	positive	Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
98_ 1	positive	I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.
323_ 7	negative	Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
132_ 315	neutral	 My ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter
132_ 481	positive	I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.
227_ 18	neutral	These issues knock a single star off the review.
132_ 193	neutral	great product with Limited Services
324_ 14	negative	This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
190_ 8	neutral	The creative came with a free trial of [random file sharing company] "to go".
124_ 6	negative	The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
199_ 14	positive	I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc.
197_ 1	negative	The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.
83_ 1	positive	Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
297_ 3	neutral	It included popup and ad blockers, referrer blockers, firewall,  intrusion detection, and all the same things that the 2004 version includes that are really needed.
132_ 364	neutral	 The Sony Walkman and Creative Zen Touch get 30 and 24 hours per charge, respe
204_ 8	neutral	I take mine everywhere.
259_ 0	positive	This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.
28_ 3	neutral	I said, can your fancy camera do that?
132_ 97	positive	 FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
66_ 2	neutral	My second child I didn't get any.
112_ 4	positive	After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
272_ 0	positive	I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
39_ 1	neutral	I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.
132_ 73	neutral	 The chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.
170_ 4	negative	I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy.
128_ 3	positive	I like the speed control.
179_ 5	neutral	Important to note that what I really needed was an access point as my DSL modem already does the router thing and I have a wired 100M network round the house.
168_ 5	positive	The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too.
195_ 23	positive	Sound: This is where I love Zen the most.
199_ 6	neutral	After reading the reviews, I was all ready for the unit to lock up on me after the initial charge...but it never happened.
132_ 407	neutral	 The other thing is the earbuds.
233_ 40	neutral	In any case , putting aside how common it is in my city , I dont think I can be anymore satisfied.
0_ 170	neutral	Great for 1st time digital camera owners who are learning the "digital" way of the photo taking force (like me) or for the experienced digital photographer who wants a powerful, easy to keep with you at all times camera.
275_ 12	neutral	but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.
196_ 12	positive	Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
111_ 17	positive	For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
315_ 2	positive	I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
0_ 184	positive	Could be better to be a perfect camera (and some competitors do some of this better): purple fringing, details in high-light area, noise over ISO100, red-eyes, (few)processing artefacts, (few)loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light, automatic autofocus, whizing while video-playback, better video comression (smaler viedo-files), more manual controls, longer lasting battery, indicator for battery, better protection of the LCD, less weight.
172_ 2	positive	Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA.
214_ 3	neutral	In addition, I didn't like the fact that I'd have to pay $.99 for each song I wanted to download.
132_ 525	neutral	 But is it worth all the hype?
170_ 8	neutral	Also use Netstat on the Linksys website which helps in setting it up.
195_ 25	neutral	I dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.
85_ 1	positive	and we definitely prefer our Champ!
271_ 1	positive	The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
150_ 0	negative	I couldn't get the install wizard to work.
174_ 17	neutral	Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.
11_ 4	positive	Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
132_ 95	positive	Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.
31_ 0	neutral	I've had this camera for three years.
39_ 5	positive	This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.
307_ 4	negative	Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
186_ 18	neutral	Enjoy!
233_ 38	neutral	Overall I dont think I will ever upgrade from this phone.
286_ 2	neutral	Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
183_ 14	neutral	1.
0_ 191	positive	I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus, manual mode, ISO 100 (shorter aperture-time, so more often sharper images as with ISO 50), auto white balance (auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well).
214_ 10	neutral	So I decided on the black one.
0_ 202	neutral	Check out the other professional reviews for this camera on the web.
299_ 8	neutral	Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.
219_ 1	negative	A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it.
193_ 16	neutral	Upon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.
179_ 0	neutral	I tried and failed using the D-Link 624 108M wireless router.
132_ 19	neutral	iRiver's seems a lot more sturdier than the iPod's.
315_ 0	positive	The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
0_ 79	neutral	totally love this feature...very useful since i love taking pics of my 7-month old baby =)
85_ 0	neutral	We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.
101_ 6	neutral	I never could get the panel bit to fit right.
178_ 14	neutral	I did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.
178_ 18	neutral	First, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.
199_ 19	neutral	I say get one today!!
268_ 21	negative	This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
319_ 2	neutral	I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.
170_ 18	negative	 So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.
23_ 2	neutral	I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.
241_ 4	positive	1) Great audio quality overall.
132_ 261	neutral	 It "feels" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).
310_ 3	positive	And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
111_ 8	neutral	Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).
132_ 422	neutral	  After talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.
36_ 19	neutral	9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.
0_ 131	neutral	All were generally favorable but i still had my doubts just because their review is based largely on the kind of photography that they do.
243_ 25	neutral	I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.
206_ 3	neutral	Although some came close to perfection, none of them left me completely happy with their performance.
298_ 16	neutral	I hope it's better than this hunk of junk Internet/AV 2004 package.
298_ 0	neutral	This came PRELOADED on our new, 2.8Mz Pentium 4 256RAM computer.
293_ 1	negative	This product is absolutely not ready for release.
222_ 2	positive	The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.
135_ 25	positive	And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting.
187_ 25	negative	Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.
88_ 0	positive	We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
54_ 15	positive	It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
136_ 22	positive	I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
166_ 30	neutral	Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.
132_ 433	neutral	 Pros Holds a ton of music.
132_ 9	negative	  DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
254_ 2	positive	Give each friend a different ringtone.
179_ 9	neutral	d be in the same IP range and see each other.
186_ 6	neutral	I ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!
113_ 4	positive	The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
223_ 15	negative	The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".
96_ 2	positive	Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.
157_ 3	positive	IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....
132_ 38	neutral	Maybe in their 5th generation they'll add features to the iPod. But for now, pleases don't buy this, and buy a Creative Zen or the iRiver H10-20GB instead.
216_ 0	positive	I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.
211_ 11	neutral	m.
187_ 15	positive	Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.
233_ 20	positive	I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
313_ 0	neutral	I really liked the firewall.
191_ 29	negative	Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.
132_ 304	neutral	When I first saw "music trivia quiz" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.
179_ 8	neutral	Then, the hardest bit was to figure out how to disable the router and the DHCP services so that all computers woul!
223_ 9	neutral	This appears to prevent the lockup issue.
307_ 2	neutral	If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.
179_ 16	neutral	For surfing the net it is more than one can hope for.
186_ 3	neutral	I visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.
225_ 34	positive	Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.
181_ 8	positive	All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.
132_ 485	neutral	After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.
179_ 1	neutral	Coverage in my 2-floor brick-walled house was poor and erratic.
228_ 1	neutral	I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like "Just go buy an Ipod!"
251_ 13	negative	Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
306_ 6	neutral	All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.
58_ 8	neutral	I just know it really worked for us.
221_ 7	neutral	Looks?
135_ 3	neutral	(The Airport was more than twice the Linksys router.)
106_ 5	neutral	And changing bits requires one hand on the wrench, one hand on the spindle lock, and two knees to hold the router -- another reason why the M12V is best used in a table.
166_ 69	neutral	You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.
147_ 4	negative	That is, you cannot access the internet at all.
187_ 18	positive	Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.
233_ 17	positive	Capacity is not a problem here.
132_ 350	neutral	  Overall, I think the iPod is a good player, although I would note some features that turned me off:
128_ 2	neutral	Because of this I have removed the handles.
132_ 470	neutral	 The only area I wish Apple had improved upon would be the screen.
191_ 11	positive	The blue backlight is pretty cool.
20_ 0	positive	I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
132_ 70	positive	 The product I rate five stars,
132_ 122	positive	 The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.
242_ 31	positive	The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
132_ 235	positive	 I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
132_ 58	positive	 The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
132_ 68	neutral	However, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.
125_ 1	neutral	If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.
234_ 6	negative	You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
143_ 4	positive	And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.
132_ 351	negative	 LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.
132_ 303	neutral	  What's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.
225_ 24	positive	rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.
11_ 0	positive	I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
170_ 10	negative	This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
187_ 19	neutral	Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.
242_ 15	positive	I've had no problems w/ this phone.
210_ 4	negative	I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.
322_ 8	neutral	I can't recommend their programs enough.
193_ 31	positive	A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.
225_ 2	neutral	Not because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.
23_ 0	neutral	Good quality and fun!
307_ 7	neutral	Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.
298_ 23	positive	 I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
166_ 59	neutral	Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.
83_ 7	neutral	I am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.
312_ 9	neutral	Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.
132_ 512	neutral	 The only other problem I have noticed is that on some uploads it will switch around CD song titles (all on the same artist, it just mixes up the titles).
187_ 6	positive	It feels tiny in the hand without it.
199_ 18	neutral	Zen Micro[+2][s] Overall, I'm very pleased with the Zen Micro and based on my experience with it (as well as it's older sibling Creative Nomad IIC), can recommend it without reservation.
0_ 26	positive	I've taken about hundred shot with the Canon, in varying lighting situations, all in auto mode, and not one blurry picture!!!
132_ 283	positive	 The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).
295_ 0	negative	Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
132_ 64	neutral	The problem with my iPod.
95_ 0	positive	Diaper Champ is great.
303_ 0	neutral	Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
134_ 15	negative	The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.
132_ 106	negative	No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
311_ 11	negative	I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
242_ 27	neutral	If you max out the phone memory and have sent all you wish to a computer, there is a memory card w/ a good deal of storage as well.
136_ 34	neutral	It is easy.
242_ 37	positive	It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
36_ 5	positive	2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!
186_ 13	neutral	I'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.
194_ 0	neutral	I got my Zen Micro last week.
296_ 3	neutral	I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.
3_ 18	negative	The flash is very weak.
268_ 7	neutral	On a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.
0_ 52	neutral	All had the same results.
96_ 0	positive	Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
117_ 2	positive	I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
36_ 14	neutral	Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.
132_ 52	neutral	This 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.
180_ 1	negative	It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.
298_ 25	neutral	If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
212_ 4	negative	Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.
205_ 15	positive	Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.
200_ 2	negative	Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well.
255_ 9	positive	I think the interface is great.
241_ 1	positive	While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
233_ 8	neutral	I think the keypad on your cell phone is the most important thing for me as Im constantly sending messages , calling people and fiddling around with my phone.
179_ 12	neutral	Also, I set up a WPA-PSK security protocol, and created a corresponding profile in my notebook.
193_ 27	neutral	I keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.
214_ 29	positive	Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.
129_ 1	neutral	Until recently it was my only router.
233_ 42	neutral	Did I mention the note feature and how you can send notes via Bluetooth?
142_ 0	neutral	I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.
166_ 70	neutral	Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.
55_ 7	positive	If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
243_ 16	neutral	The older security method is called Unit Key.
190_ 2	neutral	Mp3 players are like a blessing and a curse for people like me.
31_ 13	negative	Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
195_ 19	neutral	Dont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.
86_ 1	negative	For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
132_ 22	negative	 There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
298_ 30	neutral	WRONG - SEE MY UPDATE ABOVE.
190_ 6	neutral	I was at [random electronic store], browsing through players, and came across two that made the cut.
166_ 1	neutral	Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.
141_ 1	positive	This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE.
132_ 53	positive	The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.
249_ 0	negative	At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
132_ 349	neutral	 I had initially been planning on buying this or another Apple product, but since decided to buy a player made by a different manufacturer.
91_ 1	negative	That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
132_ 271	neutral	 My only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.
30_ 1	positive	I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
258_ 4	neutral	The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that "Can be delayed further".
161_ 0	neutral	Bought this a few months ago with the Laptop card.
222_ 6	neutral	Mine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.
233_ 41	positive	This makes for a great phone.
166_ 42	neutral	Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.
225_ 11	positive	The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
168_ 6	neutral	Speed is identical to my hard wire desktop direct cable modem connected PC.
229_ 5	neutral	An Apple Ipod Mini was considered.
221_ 26	neutral	Do NOT buy Apple.
149_ 4	neutral	I'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.
208_ 5	neutral	The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.
187_ 24	negative	There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
139_ 19	positive	just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.
132_ 294	neutral	But unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.
166_ 43	neutral	I'm tr!
132_ 324	neutral	 For this reason, it is very easy to drop.
0_ 89	neutral	change the orientation to vertical and it will automatically change the time and date orientation too.
156_ 2	positive	All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.
233_ 26	positive	The use of 65536 (16bit) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
233_ 7	neutral	My dad has a Nokia 6670 before which he has a Nokia 7210 and before that he had a Nokia 6610.
138_ 0	neutral	It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.
132_ 348	neutral	 I was shopping for a MP3 player recently, and had the opportunity to play with my cousin's 20GB iPod at some length to see how I liked it.
183_ 29	neutral	3.
0_ 93	negative	the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera.
171_ 3	neutral	Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.
47_ 3	neutral	The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer.
272_ 5	positive	Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
244_ 0	neutral	The title pretty much says it all.
217_ 25	neutral	I do not work for Creative; I had a chance to play with a review copy in-depth, as others have (See Engadget, Gizmodo, or c|net as examples).
90_ 0	positive	I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
274_ 13	negative	4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
159_ 1	negative	There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.
201_ 11	neutral	:) I was also happy that my shipment came with all the accessories (minus extra battery).
207_ 3	positive	So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.
87_ 5	neutral	The reviews were definitely right.
82_ 1	positive	At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
240_ 13	positive	:! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
142_ 13	neutral	  !
311_ 8	negative	This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
151_ 0	neutral	My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.
213_ 1	positive	anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing.
5_ 15	neutral	I have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.
196_ 1	positive	Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.
35_ 2	neutral	This is the only camera with all these capabilities.
75_ 6	positive	There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
127_ 4	negative	The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
99_ 0	neutral	Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.
287_ 41	neutral	And that's a shame.
138_ 1	neutral	I had an old wired Linksys router.
5_ 3	neutral	I was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.
193_ 8	neutral	The buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.
8_ 2	positive	I love this camera.
225_ 43	negative	But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
0_ 174	positive	The included software removes any red eye easily.
139_ 18	neutral	However, if you are not a tech person and!
132_ 374	neutral	  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.
155_ 5	neutral	Expect about 10MBps and not more though!
132_ 297	neutral	 As mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.
162_ 0	neutral	I purchased the router and 1 Linksys WPC54G Wireless 54g PC Card.
138_ 12	negative	The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.
166_ 45	neutral	You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.
0_ 220	neutral	On the 60fps setting it seems like a regular video recorder!!
0_ 149	positive	The photo quality is amazing.
166_ 7	neutral	It's not here yet!
183_ 25	negative	I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone.
299_ 11	negative	After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
11_ 1	positive	This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
225_ 62	neutral	There are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means?
185_ 2	neutral	This proprietory software to download.
144_ 2	negative	The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.
313_ 4	neutral	I've tried lots of things they suggest.
160_ 1	positive	This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.
84_ 3	positive	And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
89_ 3	positive	THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
0_ 179	positive	Placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect.
116_ 3	neutral	I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.
199_ 2	neutral	When I finally couldn't take it anymore, I decided to pull the trigger on the Zen Micro.
134_ 12	neutral	But can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?
8_ 0	positive	FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
194_ 6	positive	The menu is easy to use and understand.
211_ 3	neutral	It's been in my pocket, in my car, and in my bag in 20 inches of snow and 100 degree summers.
195_ 36	negative	What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.
320_ 7	neutral	I did not use the Rnis.exe, since I have WinFax Pro on my system. I did not touch the Windows Registry, for the same reason.
100_ 11	positive	So much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!
257_ 5	neutral	Its a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.
124_ 1	neutral	I also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.
114_ 7	positive	The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
119_ 7	positive	You just can't go wrong with this one!
115_ 5	negative	After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
132_ 130	neutral	But enought of the negativity.
321_ 0	neutral	I ain't no computer geek, but I can wrestle with the best of them.
3_ 17	negative	Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
206_ 9	neutral	players that are currently available, but not the Zen Micro.
175_ 4	positive	There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.
0_ 99	positive	it's such a great camera! i think it really was worth the investment =)
207_ 12	positive	ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!
242_ 2	negative	The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
222_ 9	positive	t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?
194_ 10	positive	The earbud headphones are really nice.
192_ 12	negative	- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -
201_ 22	positive	Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable!
75_ 2	positive	This is one of the best purchases we made.
278_ 10	positive	I love this phone.
0_ 60	negative	you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight Camera shake is a problem to contend with.
209_ 28	neutral	My gatekeeper programs kept fixes away a few times until I got wise to it.
132_ 410	neutral	 With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.
132_ 415	negative	  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.
113_ 6	positive	Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
201_ 5	positive	Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.
180_ 0	negative	We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.
186_ 11	neutral	Pressed play and I was off.
0_ 14	negative	When I went to put in the new SD Card I looked at the LCD Screen -- CRACKED-- and the fluid gave a Jackson Pollock type appearance to the screen, black and blue and purple blotches and streaks --useless.
258_ 0	neutral	According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM
184_ 3	negative	The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
223_ 11	negative	where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
298_ 27	neutral	HMMMM.. Good luck.
299_ 13	neutral	Again, I tried online email support.
243_ 0	neutral	*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****
290_ 8	positive	Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
73_ 1	neutral	We have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.
191_ 5	positive	It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).
293_ 3	negative	I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
201_ 8	positive	It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy!
146_ 5	positive	I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.
287_ 6	negative	The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
315_ 1	positive	No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
220_ 6	neutral	Now the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!
54_ 3	neutral	The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.
38_ 4	neutral	Definitely a good investment.
132_ 384	positive	 The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.
3_ 9	negative	This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
151_ 9	positive	at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.
ELECTRONICS_208_5	negative	I've been searching through all the threads and forums and they say they're working on it but over 6 months?
ELECTRONICS_217_2	negative	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
VIDEOGAMES_119_3	negative	( Like in any House of the Dead game ) nothing else.
VIDEOGAMES_134_40	negative	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
VIDEOGAMES_137_14	negative	The only ones you can interact with are the little harvest sprites, located right under your shed.
VIDEOGAMES_289_8	negative	You may win one out of ten tries.
MUSIC_238_10	negative	The one song Beyonce seems to want to make a big deal about is ""Dangerously In Love"", a remake of the enchanting love Ballad first performed by Beyonce's girl group, Destiny's Child. This, I wouldn't have a problem with if it were a remake at all, instead of an exact replica.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
MUSIC_260_21	positive	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
BOOKS_169_9	negative	The only place I found this book lacking was in the ""spiritual content"" department.
VIDEOGAMES_278_8	negative	When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable.
BOOKS_147_7	negative	Many of Frymire's conclusions are naive, and a large number are just plain wrong as will be obvious to any creationists.
VIDEOGAMES_129_3	negative	You'll often find yourself trapped in a closed arena withhordes of monsters, just needing to find the right combination of Legions (your demonic partners in this game) to kill 'em all and move on.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
MUSIC_256_7	positive	The song, ""To Zion,"" merits owning the album alone.
ELECTRONICS_85_1	positive	I couldn't be happier with the wide lens, aperture control ring, manual functions, scene pre-settings, overall low light performance, and ease of customization this little camera offers.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
VIDEOGAMES_290_12	positive	It's just as fun.
VIDEOGAMES_140_23	positive	Even on medium, which I have them on, they look excellent.
ELECTRONICS_72_13	negative	They said they longer keep the accessory kit in stock, but that I should be able to get it in any electronics store.
DVDS_183_8	neutral	This flick was a waste of time to watch and the only virtue was the abled work of Kidman. Railroadjames
DVDS_193_4	positive	How could you possibly lose?
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
ELECTRONICS_232_1	neutral	Great loud full sound - great colors - and scrren, black blacks, HD. Cons: The only downer would be lack of bluray, but regular dvds look HD because the LED delievers, far superior to my LCD Short story I went in to buy the IPAD and came out with this â€“ that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_292_2	positive	You can customize hair, snowboard suit, boots, shirts and much more.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
MUSIC_107_10	neutral	8. Rainin Tears - 3/5 very slow song.
ELECTRONICS_85_12	negative	I've never used a Canon product that felt so shoddy.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
MUSIC_253_9	neutral	I find myself listing to the studio version (from back in the day) more than I do this live album.
VIDEOGAMES_289_28	positive	GC is an amazingly difficult game!
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
DVDS_191_25	negative	They are of course crap, is this what we pay for?
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
ELECTRONICS_229_5	positive	I have connected on PC's and Mac's and even connected on my Treo (which was amazingly good quality).
BOOKS_151_1	negative	Quaint, presumptuous, full of fluff, and non-stop kookery.
VIDEOGAMES_126_1	negative	This game is NOT the real Ninja Council 3, it's actually the 4th version in Japan. Since this game has no story at all, D3 decided to take Naruto: Saikyou Ninja Daikesshu 4 and modify it to be in line with the American dub of Naruto. If you're fimiliar with the previous versions of Ninja Council, prepare to be disappointed big time.
ELECTRONICS_78_0	positive	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
DVDS_198_6	positive	** see this on the IMAX and all I can say is : wow!
MUSIC_244_10	negative	It made me feel like she went into the studio and just recorded each track to the same intrumental, back to back, and called it a night.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
VIDEOGAMES_285_2	positive	Graphics: 8/10 These graphics are just blocks piled ontop of eachother to present a character....But, I guess in the time this came out...which was I believe '97.....these graphics still weren't top noch....Oh well...I don't judge games by graphics....Although...The cut scenes were fantastic!
ELECTRONICS_210_4	negative	The web site says their goal is 100% customer satisfaction and thier tech support page actually suggests that you call them but does not list a phone number.
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_142_5	positive	WWF WrestleMania X8's original gameplay engine recreates all the action, excitement and tradition WWF fans have come to love.
BOOKS_168_9	positive	The goal was to teach the reader, not impress them or bore them.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
DVDS_180_4	negative	Actually I hate to demean Homer. Well, lets hope there's someone out there that can bring Hollywood out of this quagmire of dull, over killed, underachieved and discombobulated pile of, what did I call it?
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
ELECTRONICS_80_2	negative	It really doesn't.
BOOKS_149_10	negative	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
DVDS_185_5	negative	I was in the midst of wondering why I was watching this 3rd rate film when I could have been watching ""Dear John"" instead.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
VIDEOGAMES_275_9	negative	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
MUSIC_92_0	negative	Don't waste your money on this.
ELECTRONICS_227_3	positive	The Bottom Line: Buy this camera, and if you haven't taken a decent picture before, this will make you look like a pro!
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
BOOKS_158_2	positive	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
DVDS_189_1	neutral	With cloaks flourished and hats put on and taken off ad-nauseum the two main performers Allen and Desdiri occasionally suffer from shortage of breath and at times you feel like screaming ""please just stand still"".
BOOKS_172_0	positive	Prospective novelists and fiction writers, the King of Pop Fiction has spoken!
MUSIC_244_6	negative	There was nothing deluxe about it.
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
MUSIC_236_15	negative	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!""
MUSIC_236_11	negative	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
VIDEOGAMES_128_6	negative	It is really annoying how cheap this and some places take pure luck to beat.
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
ELECTRONICS_212_3	negative	Suddenly its my fault that parts of the program remain.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
MUSIC_107_18	neutral	13. Eye on the prize remix - 4/5 I like the original one better.
ELECTRONICS_226_8	negative	My one complaint is that the slot load cd/dvd drive is very noisy.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
VIDEOGAMES_127_14	positive	The coloring of the elements are also beautiful.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
VIDEOGAMES_125_15	negative	So with all this negativity, it looks like I foolishly wasted $30 dollars to get this mediocre game shipped to me, especially already knowing that it lacked.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
ELECTRONICS_227_2	neutral	... Cons: EVF a little slow, but okay after getting used to it.
VIDEOGAMES_279_14	positive	The sound and presentation in the game are fantastic.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
MUSIC_107_7	positive	The lyrics are fun 6.Best Inspiration - 5/5 stars.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
VIDEOGAMES_115_1	neutral	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
VIDEOGAMES_137_24	positive	This new function is really cool, the game continues while you are not even playing!
MUSIC_244_8	negative	The entire first disc is nothing but power ballads, that lack just that, power.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
ELECTRONICS_85_2	positive	Even love the minimal black design of it.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
BOOKS_167_8	negative	Some may find that concept hard to buy, especially if they don't even own a pair of boots.
ELECTRONICS_207_0	positive	On the first look, the bag is great.
MUSIC_107_15	positive	11. Evolution - 5/5stars I love this song!
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
BOOKS_167_11	positive	This slim book is an interesting quick read.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_129_0	positive	I really wanted to ""love"" Chaos Legion. It had a lot of the right ingredients for a killer action game - creepy monsters, stylish combos, and lots of frenetic hack-'n'-slash melee fighting.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
ELECTRONICS_207_10	negative	This bag would be great if they would just spend two dollars more for a better closure.
BOOKS_168_20	positive	My conclusion is, this is a great book and would benefit any library.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
MUSIC_264_7	positive	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
DVDS_178_28	positive	A good idea done right by television standards, and well worth watching for free.
ELECTRONICS_234_3	neutral	Not sure its worth as much as it costs, so only 4 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_141_16	negative	Sometimes there are cheap deaths.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_22	positive	But, the games still have it good points!
ELECTRONICS_80_9	positive	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.
VIDEOGAMES_138_0	positive	I have played this game up to level 13 so far and I am very impressed with the later level designs.
ELECTRONICS_75_5	negative	It was cheaper than to get one without) It is also very noisy and performs random updates in the night, which can be annoying.
MUSIC_92_1	negative	This is the worst VH album of all time.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
BOOKS_153_0	negative	Mostly shallow ideas about meaning of life.
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
BOOKS_172_7	neutral	For those familiar with the territory, nothing here is radically new, but King states it clearly and with vigor.
VIDEOGAMES_140_5	positive	They each have their roles, and the ways they interact with their allies and opponents is a large part of the game.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
DVDS_193_18	positive	Wonderful stuff.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
DVDS_181_15	negative	Gort (the ominous almost limitless of powers guardian of the world) fell far short of taking this film to heights that it could have achieved.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
VIDEOGAMES_134_48	neutral	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
ELECTRONICS_73_20	positive	The best news is: This unit works!
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
BOOKS_161_0	neutral	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
ELECTRONICS_73_8	negative	The dealer informed me that Sony had instituted a new policy requiring that all exchanges have to be directly through Sony. I thought this was hard to believe, and called Sony. Sony confirmed that in fact, this is their policy.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
VIDEOGAMES_122_13	positive	The visuals and firefights seem great as well, grenade explosions look like they should and the flak being fired into the sky by Germans in fields around you makes it very immersive.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_236_12	negative	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
VIDEOGAMES_137_61	negative	Compared to the other HM, it's no good.
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
VIDEOGAMES_276_6	negative	Took away game play settings.
MUSIC_112_12	neutral	""Consipracy"" and ""Franklin"" also have basic lyrics, with the first being about someone losing power in a relationship, and the next being about going back to your hometown after awhile and everything (mostly peoples' reactions to you) being different.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_227_4	positive	After researching and comparing this camera (fz30) with others in this price range and higher, I decided to buy the Panasonic DMC FZ30. After two weeks of picture takin' and putting the camera through some of it's many features, (it has features galore!).
DVDS_190_1	negative	When the actors are speaking I would like to see their faces, so I can understand the dialogue.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
VIDEOGAMES_273_1	negative	until he finished it after 3 days.
BOOKS_170_1	neutral	It is an easy read, but may reguire some additional but basic review of the historical context.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
VIDEOGAMES_126_9	negative	Another thing that might piss you off is how broken this game is.
ELECTRONICS_216_28	negative	My pictures did NOT live up to ANY of my expectations.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
ELECTRONICS_223_9	negative	Yes, she replied curtly and hung up.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
MUSIC_262_5	positive	But this CD is AWSOME!!!
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
BOOKS_162_9	neutral	My advice would be this: Check out the book in electronic form, which is available at the www.econlib.org website.
DVDS_199_7	positive	Nicky Rogan (Keaton) is facing many cross-roads: his new play is about to premiere on Broadway but Rogan's dilemma is whether to avoid the possible public crucifixion by the notorious critic Steven Schwimmer (Downey in a wonderfully daffy turn) whose perchance for theatricality (he attends his works in masquerade since he has been virtually vilified by all who know him) sharpening his fangs to sink into his baby or watch the drama unfolding of his aforementioned team in the defining moment of baseball.
ELECTRONICS_234_0	positive	Simple to set up and use.
DVDS_178_29	positive	Darkness Falls felt like a Tales From The Crypt or an RL Stein's: Goosebumps episode.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
DVDS_186_5	negative	No deleted scenes & I had trouble accessing some items.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
DVDS_178_31	negative	I gave this film a 2/10. A point for the only two good scenes in this film.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
BOOKS_170_45	neutral	I'll admit that my first reaction upon completion of this tome was less impressed that I am now at writting this review.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
MUSIC_244_14	neutral	Basically the only song worth anything on this entire collection is the song ""Single Ladies"", which I'm still not bananas about.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
ELECTRONICS_229_4	neutral	Quality of the picture ultimately depends on speed of your connection.
ELECTRONICS_234_6	positive	Connected to radio first time with no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
BOOKS_169_15	positive	I enjoyed reading sections aloud to my wife and more than once getting that ""ah-ha!""
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
VIDEOGAMES_126_17	negative	I recommend neither.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_292_12	positive	It just won;t bore you.
VIDEOGAMES_118_6	negative	I don't understand why they would make a new game with no improvements.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
MUSIC_100_3	negative	The rest of the album relies too heavily on multi-tracked vocals, which bring the album's overall appeal down for me.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
DVDS_198_2	positive	as billionaire heir Bruce Wayne hellbent for vengeance for the murder of his parents which leads him on a journey of redemption from the brutal Asian prison camp after taking a nowhere-to-go downward spiral attempt at crime where he encounters the mysterious Henri Ducard (a suitable Neeson) and the ninja-training from guru of vigilantism Ra's Al Ghul (an imposing Watanabe) laying the foundation to his inner turmoil exploited into an iconic hero to thwart the evil in Gotham. Watching all the jigsaw puzzle pieces interlock from the beginnings of Wayne's brainy conceit of the Batsuit to the Humvian Batmobile are giddy joys for the inner fanboy of every squandered youth.
ELECTRONICS_231_5	positive	Really enjoy that each input has its own settings (example: input 1 (xbox) I have DCM turned off.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
MUSIC_260_17	positive	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
BOOKS_165_1	positive	It has found a home in my purse.
BOOKS_172_13	positive	A gem. Buy it.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
ELECTRONICS_214_11	negative	But, not with this new version (version 3?) of the My Book Essential Drives where it is embedded into the drive's hardware and cannot be deactivated.
ELECTRONICS_85_17	negative	The location of the flash is unfortunate in that it pops into left my hand as I try to shoot...the only other hand-hold would seem to be cupping the body from below, or shooting one-handed.
VIDEOGAMES_291_19	positive	If you stock 3 Fire cards you unleash Firaga. Graphics Graphics are pretty good.
DVDS_178_18	neutral	People might have been praising this film and comparing it alongside other made-for-TV horrors such as 'Salem's Lot, Satan's School For Girls and Trilogy Of Terror. But because it was a theatrical release costing as much as 8 bucks to see, most have trashed it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_74	negative	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
VIDEOGAMES_140_10	positive	But the AI that controls your troops in battle, responds to your commands, etc. is probably the best I have ever seen.
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_62	neutral	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
VIDEOGAMES_280_4	negative	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
DVDS_187_10	neutral	As for the actors, Zoe McLlelan and Justin Whalin give very little passion to their performances, I know them to be very good actors...
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
BOOKS_175_7	positive	I was sorry to have the story come to an end and can't wait until the sequel comes out.
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
MUSIC_97_7	negative	It's either painfully harsh or just downright boring.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_121_5	negative	Anyway I would advise you to never purchase this game unless you like making bad investments.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
VIDEOGAMES_294_6	positive	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
DVDS_188_23	neutral	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
VIDEOGAMES_143_0	positive	""Immersive"" The games still great after months of playing.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_128_10	negative	Their certainly is better Sonic games out their.
BOOKS_170_18	positive	Regardless, the author proposes several solid ideas to remove the economic incentives out of war and create policies which deny officials the coercive practices and threatening posturing of military forces against other foriegn governments for other than national defense (which said practices are used for economic coercion).
ELECTRONICS_224_13	neutral	Since the printer is missing a auto-loading document feeder scanning multiple pages can get tiresome, so if that is important to you, go for a different model.
DVDS_181_11	negative	The fact that the viewer is dragged thru a lame and less interesting plot from the original sets this movie on a train wreck collision.
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
BOOKS_145_4	negative	The essay questions are acceptable, but instead of explaining different approaches to writing the essay and evaluating the sources (like the Princeton Review) this book simply gives example essays.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
DVDS_199_10	neutral	Nicky grows increasingly wearier as the day becomes night and after a short visit with his father (""The Sopranos"" ' Aldredge) figures to ditch the premiere after all (especially when his leading man - the always welcome vet Yulin - whose addled brain can't get its grasp on a key line reading) and ducks into a local bar to add insult to injury and watch with melodramatic hubris his beloved Sox get theirs.
MUSIC_240_5	negative	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
MUSIC_110_2	positive	Raymond and his original group are the real masters of his music although the Beau Hunks are a very close second.
VIDEOGAMES_267_7	negative	Let's just say I'm glad I rented.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
VIDEOGAMES_287_1	positive	Pros: -One of the best RPG series ever of all time for ten pounds.
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
MUSIC_247_5	negative	However, it makes one yearn hard for the classic days of PF's heyday.
VIDEOGAMES_125_11	neutral	The blood doesn't stay on the mat and no damage to your opponent is my major gripe.
DVDS_178_33	negative	But those two scenes are not worth the quarter that the Tooth Fairy leaves beneath your child's pillow.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
ELECTRONICS_232_14	positive	Lastly its case is fingerprint free, its speakers are movie experience loud, hard to find on a laptop and its HDMI de ...
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
VIDEOGAMES_265_4	negative	My friend had said before I bought it to don't get it but I thought it looked so fun I wanted it and didn't know what he was talking about but then after I regretted it.
VIDEOGAMES_285_11	positive	Sounds and Music: 7/10 Well, the sound is fantastic!
VIDEOGAMES_269_15	negative	Sound : 1/10 A problem that seems to infest all the other GB FFL games, is the overly ''sad'' music.
VIDEOGAMES_272_9	negative	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
ELECTRONICS_78_5	positive	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
MUSIC_108_7	positive	GET IT!
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
ELECTRONICS_207_2	positive	Very good deviders and great to set up the way you need for your specific camera and equipment.
DVDS_189_3	neutral	I don't want to be too unkind as all singers have off nights and the audience at La Scala obviously loved him and who am I to argue with them.
ELECTRONICS_217_6	neutral	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
MUSIC_243_3	negative	The producers never even feature 1 song where his playing takes control.
VIDEOGAMES_269_20	negative	Unless you really adored the original FFL, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME!
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
MUSIC_95_2	negative	I am thinking, Kik Wear, Sonic 2000, the ones that are bright pink.
ELECTRONICS_216_17	positive	Now, even so, this is a good camera.
BOOKS_154_1	neutral	The author's ability to write is somewhat limited.
MUSIC_103_15	negative	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
DVDS_181_17	positive	There was some degree of praise to Jennifer Connelly.
BOOKS_146_11	negative	4. (NB: I am neither a Jew nor an Arab) It sickens me to see the gross racial prejudice of the author.
VIDEOGAMES_133_9	negative	If you have the choice between this and Pokemon then buy Pokemon.
ELECTRONICS_232_9	positive	This lets you know that your actually running this thing easy, and that it can handle even the toughest jobs.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
MUSIC_238_11	neutral	The only songs that are worth bearing at all are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Yes"", an abstinance song I see making the top 40 in the future.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_142_7	positive	Master each Superstar's unique wrestling style and turn the tide of the match through a combination of counters, reversals and bone-shattering finishing moves.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
BOOKS_146_18	negative	It won't taste nice, and its a bore.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_127_21	negative	~Gameplay: 3/10~ SSBB gameplay is good for the first day and a half, after that it drops dead faster than you can say ""let down.""
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
VIDEOGAMES_124_2	negative	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_265_0	negative	""Disappointing"" I love the whole sims 2 series but for me this game was fun at first but got boring after 2 days.
DVDS_192_24	neutral	It's not a bad movie, but it doesn't even come close to the epic saga the game presented to the player.
DVDS_193_3	positive	Add in a proven plotline with a long pedigree (Hand that rocks the cradle, Single White Female, many more), some great whacky dialog, and top it off with the inspired idea of a corporate thriller set in a cookie company with the climax in an industrial kitchen, and yeah...I'll bank that.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_132_10	negative	The character models and karts are especially blocky, while the worlds are alright, but have only been slightly touched up from the N64 version.
BOOKS_155_6	neutral	Spooky! There's also a ""meat marionette"" named Shenk who puts Igor to shame.
VIDEOGAMES_135_3	positive	It is an adventurous game that provides lots of gameplay and excellent graphics Gamplay- Amazing!
VIDEOGAMES_136_14	positive	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
VIDEOGAMES_291_21	positive	IN this game the Opening scene has the normal cutscene graphics as KH, same as the end.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
MUSIC_264_3	positive	The first is the ""string,"" (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
ELECTRONICS_208_6	negative	For now, I would just skip buying this sensor and just download an app.
VIDEOGAMES_134_72	negative	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
MUSIC_253_4	neutral	There are a few complaints I have, but it won't keep me from listening to the album.
MUSIC_243_1	negative	Sounds like a mix between Urban and Black, with alot of old tired riffs.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
VIDEOGAMES_266_1	positive	You got to be the scorpion king and learn to kick bad guy butt while also dishing out insults.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
BOOKS_167_9	positive	Still it's clear that the author loves his ""people,"" and all races of people, as he gives solid advice to young, black men as to selling drugs--he tells them that the job of a low rate drug dealer pays nothing more than minimum wage.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
DVDS_188_26	neutral	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
VIDEOGAMES_278_4	negative	The other flaw is the level design.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
MUSIC_240_2	neutral	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
MUSIC_102_5	neutral	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations ""Ne Pas"" to the lust-at-first-sight of ""DÃ©sir."" It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.
BOOKS_156_14	negative	I mean really...
VIDEOGAMES_279_5	positive	Yes, I do think they are way better in this game than NBA 2k6 for the 360. The reason I feel this way is because the textures used for the skin look a lot better, have more color, and the sweat graphics look more realistic.
DVDS_182_2	negative	Lucas? If your listening....Go back and watch your own original #4. There the characters were fun and their interaction was great.
DVDS_181_10	negative	What ever you were paid it was undeserved.
BOOKS_172_16	positive	What are you waiting for?
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
DVDS_184_1	neutral	I truly think this to be an excellent movie if only I COULD see it without having to go on a distant trek (over 30 miles) because Dreamworks/Warner Bros. chooses to release this to limited theaters (400 or so) nationally.
DVDS_198_4	positive	The wraithlike incarnation of the man into batsuit avenger is a thing of Gothic beauty (echoing the Tim Burton and Frank Miller conceit) expertly designed by screenwriter David S. Goyer (the ""Blade"" trilogy to name just three successful comic book to screen adaptations) with Nolan flexes the mind, muscle and sardonic humor quintessential to a truly American original hero.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
VIDEOGAMES_288_9	positive	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
VIDEOGAMES_140_4	positive	They are very powerful, but everyone has 3 of them, and they balance each other, being the same costs/availability.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
ELECTRONICS_72_17	negative	That was about 2 months ago, and I still haven't heard from Gateway.
BOOKS_168_5	positive	Strong points * Each chapter follows a similar format which helps the reader know what to expect.
VIDEOGAMES_290_11	positive	10/10 Overall, I don't see why this game got a lower score than the others.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
ELECTRONICS_72_22	negative	When using the zoom, I find that you must have extremely steady hands when taking the pictures or you will get blurred shots.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
MUSIC_90_2	negative	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
VIDEOGAMES_136_39	positive	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!
BOOKS_171_7	positive	Try it, give it a shot, and for a few bucks you may find that you've got your back back!
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
VIDEOGAMES_293_3	positive	It is just perfect!
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
DVDS_180_9	negative	Friday The 13th Part 29! Ditto to johnny 1504 by the way.
MUSIC_261_6	positive	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
VIDEOGAMES_276_1	positive	Extra features after game play.
VIDEOGAMES_143_1	positive	Even those who don't like star wars will love the great story.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
DVDS_192_3	negative	Unfortunately, the answer is a definitive no. A bland script coupled with a less than engaging plot overshadows its CG and musical flare.
BOOKS_153_6	negative	He says things everyone else says who is dying, and what we all know to be true about death and living well.
VIDEOGAMES_280_10	negative	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
VIDEOGAMES_133_1	negative	Ghosts, abdominal snow men, Lochness, the story is almost identical to to the first.
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_139_1	neutral	The controls you have to get used to, but you will eventually.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
MUSIC_252_6	negative	Most of the other songs are saddled with sludgy, over-reverential takes that lack soul and life.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
ELECTRONICS_232_10	positive	Its screen, a 720p led, actually outperforms my 1080p Sony LCD laptop visually.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
ELECTRONICS_218_7	negative	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
MUSIC_106_4	positive	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
ELECTRONICS_232_2	positive	Pros- This I3 is actually a limited I7, and it's the processor apple was going to use in its 13inch Macbook, but it was too expensive to upgrade the rest of the components to match.
ELECTRONICS_225_4	negative	but clunky and slow as hell.
VIDEOGAMES_288_19	positive	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
DVDS_204_19	positive	proves to be the mark of a first-rate filmmaker.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_293_5	positive	The frame rate is stable even through the pace of the game is considarably faster and there are more enemies on your ass at the same time.
VIDEOGAMES_124_11	negative	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_129_11	neutral	Okay, so Chaos Legion isn't an incredibly BAD game...it's just not very exciting, either.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
MUSIC_109_9	positive	In fact, all the instruments are much better defined.
VIDEOGAMES_142_10	positive	Finally, relive the rich history surrounding WrestleMania and compete for championship glory through a host of match types including death-defying TLC matches or legendary Hell in a Cell match-ups.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
VIDEOGAMES_277_11	negative	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
VIDEOGAMES_122_11	neutral	The game was built on the Unreal Engine like America's Army, so it's at least up to par in that area.
VIDEOGAMES_126_0	negative	""Total letdown"" Let me just clear some things up first.
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_25	positive	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_157_3	positive	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
VIDEOGAMES_127_27	neutral	At this point it's just frustrating and not worth playing anymore ~Longevity: 0.1/10~ Time for the real reason I gave SSBB a 4. After SSBB loses its value in single player, it still holds up as a decent party game for a little longer.
MUSIC_256_3	neutral	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it (""Superstar"")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
BOOKS_157_9	negative	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
VIDEOGAMES_276_5	negative	Gaming grid system is gone.
VIDEOGAMES_127_12	neutral	~Graphics: 9/10~ It's too bad the fact the graphics were good didn't contribute to longevity...
DVDS_196_0	positive	BLADE RUNNER (DIRECTOR'S CUT) (1982) **** Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Brion James, William Sanderson, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, Joe Turkel. Visually atmospheric histrionics set the bleak setting of futuristic hell in Los Angeles of the dour ""blade runner"" Deckard bounty hunting renegade replicants led by psychopathic android Roy Batty (appropriately named and Hauer's best performance of his career) out to terminate his maker.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
DVDS_178_11	negative	Personally, I don't think they should make horror films that are rated either PG or PG-13. What sort of audience are they trying to appeal to when they green-light a slasher with zero gore?
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
ELECTRONICS_75_6	positive	But in terms of function and ease of use it's very good.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
MUSIC_104_2	negative	My friend got the soundtrack and i borrowed it and found that there were lots of tracks missing...
VIDEOGAMES_277_20	negative	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
MUSIC_263_3	positive	They do stuff their own way.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
DVDS_192_22	negative	Actors struggle to find the right emotions scene after scene and confused me more than once, while the script is filled with a lot of nonsensical ""going no where"" hubbub.
DVDS_187_3	negative	They were extremely short and some were even useless...
BOOKS_168_6	positive	While each author may adapt his style a little differently, the content layout remains the same.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
BOOKS_168_7	positive	* Each chapter looks to see how we can relate the OT books to the New Testament, specifically to Jesus. * The book is highly readable.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
BOOKS_158_4	neutral	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient ""scientific"" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
DVDS_197_7	neutral	The surprisingly literate screenplay by G. Cabrera Infante is an informative although fictitious timeline of events potboiling but the simmering, languid pacing deserves a heavy edit with its lethargic run time of nearly two and a half hours.
DVDS_187_23	positive	it's really great.
VIDEOGAMES_134_67	neutral	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
VIDEOGAMES_278_12	negative	While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it.
MUSIC_106_1	positive	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
MUSIC_240_10	negative	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
VIDEOGAMES_134_9	negative	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
BOOKS_146_4	negative	It is not historical fiction, it is fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_117_4	positive	The single player has some moments that are kind of funny.
VIDEOGAMES_134_63	negative	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
MUSIC_112_9	positive	The song starts slow and then builds into a great chorus as Williams sings ""Please don't get me wrong, because I'll never let this go, but I can't find the words to tell you I don't wanna be alone, but now I feel like I don't know you"", and then it's right back to the soft guitars and drums.
DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
DVDS_198_7	positive	Five words: a 90 foot Katie Holmes; how can you go wrong!!
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
MUSIC_105_1	positive	This orriginal album shows alot of talent and includes a number of styles of music, So it suits everyones taste in music from hiphop to rock.
ELECTRONICS_84_5	positive	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
ELECTRONICS_84_6	positive	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
VIDEOGAMES_288_8	positive	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_116_1	negative	After trying them out, I can only describe them as tedious.
MUSIC_114_16	positive	I've heard the first GH album, and it's equally amazing...
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
MUSIC_92_2	negative	Even Van Halen 3 is better than this.
VIDEOGAMES_125_9	neutral	Sounds effects are present but somewhat lacking.
ELECTRONICS_224_6	positive	Windows support includes a wonderful installer that automatically locates all networked printers and installs the correct drivers for them (which is nice since we have 2 other canon printers in our office: IR1023 and a 4080 with H1 attachment).
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
MUSIC_107_24	positive	Nice relaxation album.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_288_20	positive	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
VIDEOGAMES_129_5	negative	This sort of stop-and-go fighting takes away from the sense of danger that a game like this is supposed to have.
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
VIDEOGAMES_288_24	negative	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
BOOKS_165_0	positive	First let me tell you I try to read a chapter every day.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
VIDEOGAMES_136_33	negative	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
VIDEOGAMES_276_18	negative	Converting this game to the DS could have been a lot simpler and would have given the fans more of what they wanted.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
MUSIC_105_10	positive	i would give this album 9/10
ELECTRONICS_219_5	neutral	Meanwhile, if you do all your computing/database use on a single machine, Bento's fine.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
ELECTRONICS_222_6	positive	and I think it is pretty.
MUSIC_235_2	negative	Please don't buy it...
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
MUSIC_94_3	negative	for shame...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_39	negative	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
BOOKS_165_2	positive	My husband also loved this book.
VIDEOGAMES_143_11	positive	Bottom line love Star wars get it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
ELECTRONICS_84_4	neutral	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
MUSIC_94_11	negative	again, the cure song sux...
VIDEOGAMES_119_2	negative	The rest is going forward mindlessly shooting at braindead monsters that dance forward and backwards.
DVDS_178_15	negative	It only sounded like a good idea, but the finished product gave me a tooth-ache.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
MUSIC_114_14	positive	You're going to wish you had this when you find it's no longer available; so do yourself a favor and get it now.
MUSIC_251_2	neutral	I wasn't impressed.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_81	negative	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.
ELECTRONICS_213_9	negative	Very poor quality and design.
VIDEOGAMES_276_0	positive	Pros: The cover actually has Cornet on it.
MUSIC_244_20	negative	Because if there ever was a Beyonce album to forget in the dust it's definately this one.
BOOKS_170_22	neutral	There is nothing too shocking nor distasteful in the language or presentation of the text and the subject matter is argued fairly if not unemoutionally.
DVDS_186_2	neutral	I could not follow the story with some of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_74_9	negative	The power cable (AC adapter) is similarly integrated into the amplifier.
ELECTRONICS_76_2	neutral	It is rugged and simple.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_265_3	negative	This game also doesn't have a lot of building items, after I made a couple places my houses started to look the same.
VIDEOGAMES_277_7	negative	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
DVDS_204_16	positive	We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
MUSIC_247_3	negative	Gilmour's attempts at emulating Roger's unique lyricism have fallen somewhat short.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
BOOKS_170_23	positive	This book is a good example of how courageous personal action (whistle blowing) can overcome a broader trend towards pervasive and powerful corruption and may inspire what is popularly called ""civil disobedience"" for righteous causes.
VIDEOGAMES_289_7	negative	If you graduate to intelligent enemies, the game is ""very challenging,"" aka ""painful.""
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
ELECTRONICS_76_4	negative	It is almost too simple and lacks preferences or options.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
VIDEOGAMES_136_19	positive	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
BOOKS_173_3	positive	With the perfect blend of honesty, humor, and humble wisdom, A Million Miles inspires readers to create a new story--a better story.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
DVDS_178_25	negative	As a theatrical movie, I rated this film a 2/10 because it was lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
VIDEOGAMES_288_16	neutral	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
ELECTRONICS_226_2	positive	There is enough room to store my whole music collection plus many photos.
VIDEOGAMES_137_6	neutral	Gameplay â€“ Not a very good gameplay, unlike other Harvest Moon, but still some good points.
ELECTRONICS_232_8	neutral	This I3 is an I7 limited to I3 capabilities, its easier to just handicap these, than make 3 different models.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
ELECTRONICS_76_9	neutral	The whole idea of its use and presence is more as a deterrent rather then actually as a locator so it does work well for those purposes.
ELECTRONICS_216_11	negative	It lets you adjust exposure + or -2, but the pics look terrible!
MUSIC_258_5	positive	We can't wait for Beethoven's Wig 3!
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
DVDS_192_27	neutral	My exact rating for this movie is a 5.8
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
DVDS_190_0	neutral	This could have been a great thriller had the director not used that shaky camera technique that is so popular right now.
MUSIC_114_0	positive	My music find of the year - mesmerizing!
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
VIDEOGAMES_275_5	negative	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
DVDS_189_5	positive	Of the women Edita Gruberova, as you would expect, gives the overall polished performance, her pure voice ringing out like a bell with never a hint of a screech.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
ELECTRONICS_72_26	neutral	Overall, the camera is not bad, and I'm satisfied with what I got for what I paid.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
VIDEOGAMES_126_15	positive	One good thing about this game is it feature voices from the anime while performing a jutsu.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_132_15	neutral	The online and multiplayer aspect help in the replay value as well giving it a moderate replay value.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_276_16	negative	What time they spent redrawing those expressions they could have used to maintain the original grid system format for the DS. A different issue is the gameplay settings: Easy(aka never played a video game in your life), Medium (aka played one rpg), and Hard (aka easy mode on normal rpgs) have disappeared.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
VIDEOGAMES_122_14	neutral	As for commanding the squad, it is easy and is a great idea, but the tactics are always the same: pin down the enemy and then find the ONLY route on the map to flank the enemy, as there is usually only one route to do so.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
DVDS_177_13	negative	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
MUSIC_259_3	positive	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
ELECTRONICS_84_7	positive	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_134_71	negative	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
DVDS_187_13	negative	As for Jeremy Irons... I don't really want to go there.
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
BOOKS_158_7	negative	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
BOOKS_170_30	positive	For many it will confirm that ""War is a Racket"" (The author explains exactly what he means by this statment) and I percieve that a vast majority would agree with the author on his definition.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
MUSIC_87_3	negative	Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions.
VIDEOGAMES_127_28	negative	Barely. Soon this game becomes another case with a disc inside collecting dust on your shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
DVDS_178_30	positive	And if you rate it along those lines, then it would have been good, and very much talked about.
VIDEOGAMES_137_31	positive	Even though they're like â€œpicturesâ€? they still look great like this!
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
VIDEOGAMES_281_10	negative	Even the special effects are lacking.
ELECTRONICS_228_2	positive	The others have been going strong and they don't use much battery power.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
MUSIC_264_6	positive	Yes, there are instruments.
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
ELECTRONICS_233_2	negative	I do have an issue with noise (especially when it is windy).
ELECTRONICS_232_5	positive	Its got 1696 video memory compared to my Macs 512, a 7200 rpm drive compared to the Macs 5200, both have led screens, but the Macs got 1280 by 800 compared to this which has only 1366 by 768 â€“ though it doesn't seem to matter.
MUSIC_107_6	positive	4.One on One - 4/5stars I like the beats and the chorus 5. Phatt A55 - 5/5stars haha fun song to sing along to.
DVDS_181_16	negative	Finally, the ending smacks of confusion and disappointment never accomplishing anything of merit.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
MUSIC_252_3	neutral	""Red Hot"" is far and away the best number on this mostly disappointing disc, as Eric and band quit sounding as reverential as church, and sprint thru the number with gusto.
VIDEOGAMES_136_7	neutral	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
ELECTRONICS_216_0	neutral	Pros: Fits in shirt pocket - Great Battery Life - Lots of Megapixels ... Cons: No lighting control - terrible auto settings - jitter light always on I bought this camera last week wanting a camera that is small yet does everything; I clearly made a mistake.
VIDEOGAMES_278_9	negative	Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting.
VIDEOGAMES_270_5	neutral	its got pretty good graphics and the gameplay is pretty nice untill well, u beat it in the first 2 hours.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
VIDEOGAMES_124_10	negative	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
ELECTRONICS_209_3	negative	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
MUSIC_241_3	negative	Which leads me to believe that this, and other TJB CD's in Herb Alpert's Signature Series, were mastered to CD directly from the original mixdown album masters that were used to press the original A&M vinyl LP's back in the 1960s (a common practice that was routinly done by the record industry with past album masters during the dawn of the CD era 25 years ago, which magnified the imperfections of analog album masters on CD).
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
VIDEOGAMES_286_2	positive	One of the best shooters of all time it is better on the Xbox than on the PC. Its graphics could have been a little bit better, but it is still one of the best Xbox launch titles.
BOOKS_162_10	negative	If you like it, by all means buy a paper edition -- but not this one!
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
ELECTRONICS_225_1	positive	Hookup was easy and after dealing with a few issues caused by norton blocking the connection to the drive we are all good to go.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
VIDEOGAMES_271_5	negative	The controls just always feel awkward no matter how much you tweak your key mapping.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
DVDS_177_9	negative	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
VIDEOGAMES_141_8	negative	However, at this point in the game, the draw distances become smaller, and the game looks just about as good as it did on the ps2.
ELECTRONICS_209_2	negative	My T720 has broke down several times.
VIDEOGAMES_269_22	negative	DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS GAME!
DVDS_193_13	positive	The highlight for me is some of the whacky dialog, which I'm still quoting years later.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
BOOKS_170_32	neutral	Although frequently expressing his fervent compassion for the 'soldier in the trenches', some soldiers may find this book both revealing of the truth and/or offensive to their honor: both revealing the varied manipulation of their's and their families sacrifices while offending the personal integrity of others (most likely those in leadership positions).
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
VIDEOGAMES_143_8	negative	The graphics are the only flaw.
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_281_11	neutral	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_232_4	positive	I'm saying that except for those last two things I mentioned, and the fact that its running windows â€“ this baby matches the power of a 2200 dollar Mac book.
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
VIDEOGAMES_134_17	negative	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
ELECTRONICS_218_12	negative	Very disappointing.
VIDEOGAMES_122_9	negative	Come on - you don't have to be a genius to note that an MG42 is going to tear a wooden fence to bits and pieces, so why would the majority of the cover provided be thin wood or tin?
DVDS_188_29	neutral	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
BOOKS_157_6	neutral	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
MUSIC_264_0	positive	This record blows my mind.
ELECTRONICS_77_5	negative	Very expensive compared to others.
VIDEOGAMES_279_12	negative	The game seems to play more simulation type of bball, but the numbers at the end of a game don't follow.
BOOKS_172_14	positive	Read it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_5	negative	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
VIDEOGAMES_289_0	positive	""Innovative"" I played GC endlessly when it came out.
DVDS_193_0	neutral	**** REVIEW INCLUDES ""GREAT DIALOG"" SPOILERS **** Wow was I surprised to see all the positive reviews of this movie here on Amazon. I thought I was alone in being entertained by this.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
ELECTRONICS_223_11	neutral	Luck decided to favor me, and after indicating XP to look for the drivers in C:\Program Files\Logitech\QuickCam10WebInstall, I was at last home.
VIDEOGAMES_140_6	positive	All in all I think the game is a sophisticated chess match, and like chess takes many hours to master, so don't buy this game if you are short on time.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
VIDEOGAMES_134_12	negative	He has no depth.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
ELECTRONICS_213_1	positive	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
MUSIC_86_12	negative	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
VIDEOGAMES_137_60	negative	But if you have money for one more HM, don't buy this one, it's the worst of them all.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_276_17	negative	Admittedly, I'm sure we didn't NEED the settings, but if anything, making Rhapsody HARDER or adding an experience booster would've better than eliminating the settings all together.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
ELECTRONICS_213_5	negative	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
MUSIC_248_1	neutral	I was neither blown away or horrified by this selection for the simple reason that the album is predictable and safe.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
VIDEOGAMES_282_18	neutral	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
VIDEOGAMES_137_35	positive	But that's the only detail I can think of, because, for a Gameboy game, they did pretty well for the graphics!
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
DVDS_193_5	positive	Actually I really like this movie, even just watching it straight.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
MUSIC_97_6	negative	What's with the rest of this junk?
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
VIDEOGAMES_138_5	negative	The sound is also a let down because you can hear the enemies uttering similar remarks throughout the game - sometimes giving away their position.
VIDEOGAMES_137_23	positive	After befriending the Harvest Sprites, they will actually work for you while you sleep!
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
VIDEOGAMES_134_19	negative	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
VIDEOGAMES_141_18	negative	Maps to big.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
DVDS_190_8	neutral	It's worth seeing on DVD just to get an idea of what's going on in Africa.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
DVDS_177_4	negative	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
BOOKS_166_4	positive	To get the story he drops into whaling expeditions and arctic research explorations with equal aplomb by chipping in and becoming one of the team.
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
MUSIC_111_2	neutral	Sure, the bass drum has little punch, but it is still there in the LFE channel.
VIDEOGAMES_127_35	negative	This game is barely worth a rent, because you'll lose interest quick.
VIDEOGAMES_267_5	negative	Awesome eh?
MUSIC_107_23	positive	Also, it fits perfectly in my collection of ""chill-out"" music.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
BOOKS_155_0	positive	As an avid Koontz fan (that sounds nasty, doesn't it) I enjoyed ""Demon Seed."" I haven't read all his stuff and almost passed this one up because, um, ""Demon Seed""?!?
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
DVDS_197_9	neutral	Although I love Bill Murray, his unnamed ""Writer"", is a court jester ham bone comic sidekick that is at times a tad distracting; oh who am I kidding - I loved him!
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
VIDEOGAMES_137_18	negative	There are still 5-6 festivals, but all you can do to participate is to talk to the shopkeepers (only way you can interact with them, but they always say the same things).
DVDS_202_8	positive	Kudos to the grimy yet clear-eyed cinematography by John Christian Rosenlund, Eve Cauley's earth tone sepias production design and the right-on-the-money period costume design by Tere Duncan giving it a timeless late '50s â€“ early '60s vibe.
DVDS_205_8	positive	Based loosely on a novel by Brett Halliday, ""Bodies Are Where You Find Them"", the story focuses on small-time petty New York City criminal Harold ""Harry"" Lockhart (Downey also making a fine comeback to comedy in a well-suited performance tailor made for his fast-talking, sharp minded spite) who winds up an unlikely actor wanna be when a Christmas-time burglary attempt has the pursued by cops Harry bolting unannounced into a late-night film audition where he finds himself overwrought with guilt of his partner's demise which adds hilarity to his 'motive' when he reads the script shoved into his hands which just happens to be a policier (!) and the casting agent Dabney Shaw(funnyman scene-stealer Miller) hires him on the spot.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
VIDEOGAMES_132_16	positive	Multiplayer in both the N64 and DS versions of the game are extremely alike, and are good natured fun with friends.
BOOKS_150_0	negative	This book alleges scandalous, hideous misdeeds on the part of distinguished scientists such as Napoleon Chagnon and James Neel. But all of the book's main accusations have been thoroughly refuted, and the only genuine scandal here is the way the author, Patrick Tierney, has fabricated and distorted reality in order to sell some books.
VIDEOGAMES_285_6	positive	Well....You do what any badass ex-marshal would do; Go on a rampage and kill every one of those little Mutta Fu...nevermind....You just kill em all.
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
MUSIC_95_4	negative	Um, the guitar player, you can tell he has fat pockets too, and fat licks.
VIDEOGAMES_136_16	positive	But it doesn't end here!
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
BOOKS_170_16	neutral	Some criticism may be generated by the idea that his dissident cries were for politcal gain, having run for political office and political activism.
VIDEOGAMES_276_3	negative	No ability to change from English to Japanese in the music/subtitles.
MUSIC_114_13	positive	The album was good enough to make me go and locate all Polyphemus material I could find.
VIDEOGAMES_132_13	neutral	In this game's case it has moderate replay value.
BOOKS_156_16	negative	I mean the title alone is so apropos.
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
MUSIC_253_8	neutral	I'm sorry people no one can beat or sing Commissioned songs better than Commissioned!!
MUSIC_245_5	negative	I'd stay away from Captiol CD's or compilation CD's which include Capitol re-recordings of the Andrews like this one.
BOOKS_171_5	positive	Then I read this book, gave its simple plan a try and realized less than two weeks later that my back pain was gone.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
VIDEOGAMES_136_27	positive	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
DVDS_187_14	negative	I'm very fond of his previous work and I really think that he couldn't have played a worse Profion even if he had tried.
DVDS_191_26	negative	Crap! We will of course see the next film in the series.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
BOOKS_172_15	positive	Then read it again.
DVDS_181_3	negative	Not even close.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
BOOKS_157_4	positive	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_134_43	negative	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
VIDEOGAMES_286_1	positive	It has such a rich campaign mode and the fact you can do co-op is a great feature.
VIDEOGAMES_144_7	negative	Be aware that the game will likely crash for you at some point.
MUSIC_244_17	negative	It definately seems like I'm bashing Beyonce in this review, but I'm not bashing her, I'm bashing her feeble effort in this album release.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
MUSIC_264_2	positive	There are two big ""wow"" points here.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
VIDEOGAMES_134_77	negative	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
ELECTRONICS_73_22	positive	Additionally, the rewind/fast forward features for videotapes are quite rapid.
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
VIDEOGAMES_124_8	negative	I also went right through a bench once.
BOOKS_150_7	negative	He distorts his printed sources, omits evidence in these sources that refutes his accusations, and invents material that isn't actually there (there are currently many web sites which document this dishonesty in a point-by-point manner, although Amazon asks that reviewers not include URLs in their reviews).
VIDEOGAMES_265_6	negative	I was highly disapointed with this game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_51	neutral	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
ELECTRONICS_72_14	negative	Yeah, right.
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
MUSIC_257_3	positive	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
MUSIC_261_2	positive	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
MUSIC_239_4	negative	Chingy is just another one of those rappers that put out wack music just because he's guarnteed to at least go platnium or even more.
VIDEOGAMES_270_3	negative	not really any replay value and theres only 1 special unlock at the end of the game, after u get that its boring.
BOOKS_145_6	neutral	The first chapter of the Princeton Review goes into great detail about how to prepare and what strategies to use on the AP Test. This book does have lots of questions on US History, but I would recommend using free resources (like old AP tests) over purchasing this book.
BOOKS_168_19	neutral	After his remarkable work on the introduction, I was hoping he would contribute in other places.
ELECTRONICS_83_2	positive	I bought this TV off of eBay for $300 in 2006 when the average price was for 800 - 1,000. The picture is excellent as well as the sound.
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
BOOKS_148_6	negative	Secondly, I found myself distracted by the ham-handed writing quality.
DVDS_190_2	negative	The camera was so often in the background I felt like I was eavesdropping on the conversations instead of in on the conversations.
VIDEOGAMES_292_7	positive	It's your choice.
ELECTRONICS_214_7	neutral	Like many people, I have no need for their backup or security software as I just want external drivers for pure storage.
MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
MUSIC_245_3	neutral	In the 50's they re-recorded their hits for Capitol and 3 of them are here - Rum and Coca Cola, I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time, and Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (the rest, however are originals, Begin the Beguine is super.)
MUSIC_86_17	negative	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_271_2	negative	By comparison this game makes the transfer of Mass Effect from Xbox to PC look like a carefully designed masterpiece.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
VIDEOGAMES_291_26	positive	The sound is terrific.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
VIDEOGAMES_128_11	neutral	If you want great 2D Sonic expirience I recommend Sonic and Knuckles or Sonic Rush. But if you want a 2D Sonic game your PC I guess this would have to do.
ELECTRONICS_224_4	neutral	Snow Leopard is currently unsupported as of the time of this review.
BOOKS_156_17	positive	Recommended, if only because its a very short read.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_136_15	positive	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
DVDS_196_1	positive	Iconoclastic blend of sci-fi and film noir with dazzling set design.
ELECTRONICS_220_2	neutral	Maybe I've not set it up correctly.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
VIDEOGAMES_131_2	negative	It's one of the few shooters I've ever played where I was hoping the game would end sooner.
ELECTRONICS_214_5	negative	I own seven other Western Digital hard drives and I will not own this one.
DVDS_192_16	negative	While I know this is the nature of any magical world, it's overdone to the point of distracting the viewer.
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
VIDEOGAMES_143_6	positive	Plenty of force powers and items to use.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
ELECTRONICS_73_21	neutral	I have been using this unit for one month, and it plays DVDs satisfactorily, as well as videotapes.
DVDS_181_20	negative	What I've learned now is...Don't get your hopes up.
VIDEOGAMES_124_17	negative	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
DVDS_177_2	negative	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
VIDEOGAMES_137_41	negative	But, it's like that with all of the Harvest Moonsâ€¦
BOOKS_166_5	positive	(The comparison is not unlike the cinematographers who capture on film the drama of a Mt. Everest ascent: the only way to get the picture is to strap on the gear and make the climb themselves, right alongside the adventurers they're filming.)
ELECTRONICS_73_28	neutral	In summary, I am satisfied with the performance of my Sony SLV-D550P DVD player.
VIDEOGAMES_136_32	positive	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
VIDEOGAMES_115_4	negative	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
VIDEOGAMES_287_9	positive	-Choose your character's allignment (from 'goody-goody two shoes' to 'completely neutral' to 'murderous lunatic'.
VIDEOGAMES_134_15	negative	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
VIDEOGAMES_293_2	positive	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!
MUSIC_241_1	negative	From listening to this CD, I can hear distortion and an audible amount of tape hiss, especially through the quiet passages of ""I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face"".
MUSIC_93_6	negative	They're gone.
BOOKS_161_4	negative	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
DVDS_181_1	negative	Fox...shame on you.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
MUSIC_236_13	negative	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: ""9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty"" James Bone Theme is about right.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
BOOKS_150_10	neutral	So read it if you want - just consider it fiction.
VIDEOGAMES_275_0	neutral	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
VIDEOGAMES_122_8	negative	I would LOVE to know what was going through the minds of the designers for Brothers In Arms when it comes to that portion of the game.
ELECTRONICS_77_2	positive	Netgear software makes me buy them over and over...
VIDEOGAMES_137_15	negative	However, they almost always say the same phrase everyday, and they're not very talkative (â€¦). As for the mountain, there is simply none!
MUSIC_94_10	positive	has a better groove and the vocals are better delivered...
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
VIDEOGAMES_141_9	positive	However, in sunny VZ, the game looks nice.
ELECTRONICS_216_25	positive	Okay, my conclusion is this: this camera is a beautifully engineered piece of camera.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
VIDEOGAMES_137_44	negative	Whatever the season, the music, you will get sick to hear it, so take off the sound on your Gameboy, choose one of your favourite songs, find a CD player and enjoy good music while playing the game!
VIDEOGAMES_280_6	negative	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
VIDEOGAMES_116_6	neutral	This may be fun for some occasions, but I would recommend highly you try out the game before you buy.
ELECTRONICS_82_2	positive	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
BOOKS_170_27	neutral	They may be treated with muted respect considering the lack of accessable current day examples and improved battle field medicine.
VIDEOGAMES_271_15	negative	Don't buy under any circumstances.
VIDEOGAMES_144_9	neutral	Bugs are the primary reason I believe this game isn't a solid 9.
VIDEOGAMES_283_0	negative	""Almost, but not quite"" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
VIDEOGAMES_140_15	positive	The second thing that sets this game apart is the 4 races.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_285_1	positive	Well, I first got into this game in a PC Gamer magazine demo-disk....I thought it was fun, and shelled out the $20 dollars for it...I loved every minute of the game!
VIDEOGAMES_274_1	negative	... Cons: Everything....
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
MUSIC_248_7	positive	Rounding off the album are some great end of the night belters from X-Press 2, Alcatraz and Grace. I've been ever increasingly worried about the quality of the compilations coming out of HK towers of late.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
VIDEOGAMES_277_23	negative	This is not fun.
ELECTRONICS_85_9	positive	There is even a simple 3x3 grid you can turn on to help you compose in the frame: can't begin to say how useful that is.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
BOOKS_158_12	neutral	2.5/5 stars.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
DVDS_195_10	neutral	Not the best actor America ever produced, but certainly one the camera loved.
VIDEOGAMES_133_0	neutral	""Ambitious"" OK the game is basically the same as Star-force 1. What happened to a variety of bosses instead of a theme, Seriously cryptids.
VIDEOGAMES_134_50	positive	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
MUSIC_110_3	positive	Raymond left no room for error on his recordings and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_280_7	negative	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
MUSIC_244_15	negative	Beyonce, you're incredible, but this album was a slap in the face to all of your fans and anyone who even mildly liked you.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
ELECTRONICS_213_11	negative	Highly not recommend it.
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
VIDEOGAMES_272_17	negative	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
VIDEOGAMES_278_3	negative	The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window.
VIDEOGAMES_117_2	positive	It is cool to blow big holes in the side of buildings.
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
MUSIC_246_0	negative	Anyone can easily tell these are not the original hits.
VIDEOGAMES_125_8	negative	The music is horrible and I am not one to even mention the music.
VIDEOGAMES_126_4	neutral	While this game is easy for the most part, some missions will cause frustration due to hazards in a level or little time to complete a mission.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
MUSIC_106_6	positive	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
BOOKS_175_0	positive	Another great book from a great author.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
VIDEOGAMES_136_21	neutral	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
VIDEOGAMES_135_6	positive	Sound- Amazing!!!
MUSIC_96_6	neutral	3 stars for the great memories If you need details about the musicians, songs, and producer, read the other reviews: it's all covered quite well.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
VIDEOGAMES_284_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
VIDEOGAMES_134_16	negative	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
ELECTRONICS_77_3	positive	much easier to connect to networks compared to using XP and other software.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
BOOKS_149_12	negative	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.
VIDEOGAMES_293_6	positive	I didn't experience any slow downs or others issues.
MUSIC_238_7	negative	But the absolutely worst song on this album would have to be ""Gift From Virgo""; Six minutes of Beyonce throwing her voice all up and down the octave chart with words so incredibly vapid you would think a valley girl with a 2.0 grade point average had written it.
VIDEOGAMES_129_12	positive	Fans of the mindless hack-'n'-slash might just like this one as a rental.
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
ELECTRONICS_85_8	positive	I'm using it almost daily and haven't yet gotten over how powerful this point and shoot is.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
VIDEOGAMES_116_4	negative	Some require pushing A, others you have to select options with the cursor then click A, others require jumping to get a random dice roll.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
BOOKS_148_9	negative	factor was crippled by giving away too much too soon.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
MUSIC_249_5	neutral	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
MUSIC_258_0	positive	Only 5 Stars!!!
VIDEOGAMES_137_26	positive	Another cool thing is that you can choose I you want to be a girl farmer, a boy farmer, a pet cat or a pet dog!
VIDEOGAMES_137_21	negative	You can have up to four cows and four chickens at a time, which is not much.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
DVDS_202_7	positive	A good combination of a skilled director with some interesting compositions and his actors having fun in the process (Tomei is a loopy lush in a glorified cameo and Stevens as a degenerate gambler befriended by Dillon).
ELECTRONICS_74_12	negative	This whole design seems to create an unnecessary rat's nest of wires behind my television.
MUSIC_107_16	positive	Nice chill-out feel to it.
BOOKS_174_1	positive	I am grateful, then, for Dr. Emerson Eggerichs' book, The Language of Love and Respect: Cracking the Communication Code with Your Mate (Thomas Nelson).
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
BOOKS_147_14	negative	In short this book will do more harm than good.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
ELECTRONICS_217_4	negative	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
MUSIC_257_5	positive	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_272_10	negative	Did they become smarter?
VIDEOGAMES_285_5	positive	Story: 8/10 (same as pretty much any western type anything) You are a former marshal....Bad ass dude...Well, a bunch of people want your land, along with all the land surrounding you...You kept refusing, so while you went to the store to pick up some supplies, and your wife's perfume, they murder your wife, burn down your house, and kidnap your kid!
ELECTRONICS_76_6	negative	Sometimes information is unable to be acquired.
VIDEOGAMES_140_7	positive	The game play is incredible for two reasons.
MUSIC_95_1	negative	First of all, the bass player...fat pocket, this guy must wear big raver pants, because he has such fat pocket.
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
ELECTRONICS_214_3	negative	Western Digital has decided to embed their Virtual CD Smartware into this drive so that you cannot, under any circumstances, disable or remove the VCD. It will forever mount this unwanted intrusion to your Mac (Windows is no better apparently) and their website essentially tells you that you can do nothing about it.
DVDS_189_0	neutral	With copious amounts of material swirling around in this over busy production, it is hard at times to concentrate on the performances.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
DVDS_191_7	negative	Complete disaster, no intelligens anywhere.
ELECTRONICS_216_2	negative	It doesn't let you adjust the apperture settings, and it always tends to make terrible automatic lighting choices.
MUSIC_86_9	negative	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
MUSIC_240_9	negative	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
DVDS_199_8	positive	Along the way he is avoiding his family, namely his wife Lillian (the equally gifted O'Hara) who is requesting a divorce and their teenage daughter Laurel (a great Graynor) whose dabbling into the punk era underscores her dad's rebellious nature in namely a heated affair with Joanna Bourne (a nubile Neuwirth) who is also giving Nicky an ultimatum.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
VIDEOGAMES_282_5	positive	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
ELECTRONICS_216_15	negative	BTW- the jitter light is on about 90% of the time with this camera.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
VIDEOGAMES_134_70	negative	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
MUSIC_108_0	positive	Man, this album is soo good i cannot believe!
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
BOOKS_163_2	positive	I think that he has more rhyming words than the rhyming dictionary.He also draw great pictures that really describe the scene in the book.
MUSIC_87_2	negative	""Stand up"" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
VIDEOGAMES_137_42	negative	I don't know, give us something nice to hear, that makes you want to move around!
MUSIC_260_13	positive	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
VIDEOGAMES_117_15	negative	If you want to stab someone the knife stays in your hand so you have to pull out your gun again.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
DVDS_205_18	positive	Her obsession over a fictional pulp fiction private eye man of action ""Johnny Gossamer"" is a running joke and shows just how much Black loves the thrill of the hunt in this go-for-broke popcorn flick with excessive pyrotechniques and obvious lifting from Tony Scott (kudos to cinematographer Michael Barrett and editor Jim Page for their splendid over-the-top skills).
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
MUSIC_107_17	positive	12. The End - 4/5stars Starts out slow then picks up, sounds nice.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
MUSIC_240_11	negative	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
MUSIC_105_0	positive	This fantastic cd is a (((must have))) for everyones cd collections weither they are a big fan of NERD or not.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
MUSIC_112_5	neutral	""Emergency"" and ""Brighter"" both show that the band knows how to craft catchy pop-rock songs.
VIDEOGAMES_277_18	negative	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
VIDEOGAMES_282_4	positive	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
MUSIC_112_18	positive	This band has such potential to go far: down-to-earth kids who love to hang out with their fans, catchy albums and they put on a fun and impressive live show (I was very surprised).
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
VIDEOGAMES_127_15	positive	The movements of all the characters are smooth and defined.
DVDS_187_24	neutral	I give this movie a 5 out of 10.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
VIDEOGAMES_117_14	negative	What's the point of that?
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
VIDEOGAMES_117_20	negative	I recommend that you keep your money and wait for the really good games this fall.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
ELECTRONICS_76_8	positive	This is used for vans in a service company and when it works it works very well.
VIDEOGAMES_125_3	positive	There are many characters to choose from and almost as many fighting styles.
ELECTRONICS_230_6	neutral	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
ELECTRONICS_85_3	positive	I had high expectations with this camera based on its price ($400) and the Canon name (still have an old AE-1 from 1982 and used an ELPH powershot extensively), and as far as image quality I can't really find any faults.
DVDS_179_8	negative	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
DVDS_194_5	negative	The stupidest quote in this movie was by Sue storm when Von doom says: Let's not fight.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
DVDS_177_1	negative	They made a sequel!
ELECTRONICS_79_5	positive	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
VIDEOGAMES_134_8	negative	Character themes are mellow and boring.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
MUSIC_253_6	neutral	I didn't care to much for RFC vocals overriding the voices of Commissioned on a couple of tracks.
MUSIC_237_5	negative	An uncommon misstep for Moby.
BOOKS_165_6	positive	I got it back a couple days later with post-it note hanging out on all sides!
MUSIC_238_4	negative	On ""Dangerously In Love"", she hands some of the control over into apparently very unable hands.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_7	neutral	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
VIDEOGAMES_272_3	negative	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
BOOKS_155_3	neutral	This is a quick read and, okay, not very deep.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
ELECTRONICS_206_3	negative	2. The claims about ""up to 500% more wireless coverage"" did not translate into a much improved signal for my remote computers - I only saw very marginal improvement on the prior Netgear router I was using!
BOOKS_173_5	positive	He and Susan Isaacs did a great job.
VIDEOGAMES_269_9	negative	The only problem with FFL2 is the fact that you never gain a ''level'' you just randomly gain stats, which gets annoying, since you have to spend so much more time ''level'' building, than any other RPG I've played.
MUSIC_256_9	positive	Simply amazing.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
MUSIC_260_5	neutral	""Released When You Are Dead"" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
BOOKS_153_1	neutral	Best for teenagers and those with no introversion.
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
VIDEOGAMES_273_9	negative	It was a total waste of my money.
MUSIC_94_1	negative	perhaps the reason robert smith had to do the song all by his lonesome: the other members openly hate DM... in fact, even smith has made it a habit to rip on DM for many years...
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
BOOKS_158_5	neutral	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
DVDS_204_18	positive	Never before in my 22 years of film reviewing have I had the experience of having a fellow audience member turn to me as the first end credits began to ask me ""What do you think happens to him?""
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
VIDEOGAMES_141_17	negative	For example, 30 guys with RPG's will shoot at you all at once.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
ELECTRONICS_216_1	neutral	I tested this camera in all types of lighting, yet it rarely took outstanding pictures.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_134_61	negative	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_224_8	neutral	My experience has been that getting a Canon printer up and running with Windows takes 5-10 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
DVDS_177_5	negative	well looked as fake as it was....
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_269_7	neutral	Controls : 5/10 Nothing really bad, typical GameBoy RPG controls, you'll get used to them very quickly.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
DVDS_203_1	neutral	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
MUSIC_98_5	negative	Gone is the wonderfully fat bass line, especially those G's (G1 on your piano keyboard).
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
VIDEOGAMES_133_2	neutral	At least the main character is less whiny.
ELECTRONICS_216_23	positive	5. The screen size is a pleasure.
MUSIC_109_6	positive	It is more like the players are performing on a stage in front of you as opposed to mono's non-dimensionality.
DVDS_193_11	positive	It actually has a lot of good stuff in it.
ELECTRONICS_227_1	positive	12X zoom, 8MP, etc.. no need to repeat.
DVDS_188_24	neutral	Let's face it; the ""who's the killer?
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
MUSIC_254_28	neutral	Perhaps something like Koop or old Zero7...? I'll still see her when she tours.
BOOKS_151_3	negative	Magnetism is personal power and the author's treatise on how to attain it is total bunk peppered with pseudo-science.
MUSIC_245_2	negative	This is NOT the great version I heard!!!
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
DVDS_178_8	negative	People lose their last Baby-Tooth every day, but it is never explained in this movie why this Tooth-Fairy hasn't paid deadly visits to others throughout the world.
DVDS_194_8	positive	Oh well I still loved this movie!
BOOKS_170_29	positive	The authors observations will give credence to the gutt reaction of many towards war: that their is much lacking in it's purpose, morality and worthiness with hopes that its text will motivate us as a people to raise the bar of restraint and accountability of our elected officals as it relates to war and war profiteering.
BOOKS_169_17	positive	I give this book 4 out of five stars.
MUSIC_107_3	positive	her voice is great in this song 2.Cliche Interlude + Cliche - 5/5 stars.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_137_25	positive	Also, if you like growing crops and having huge fields of carrots, cabbages, turnips, eggplants, grass, whatever of the many vegetables available, you have plenty of space to work on, 'cause your field is really large!
BOOKS_149_6	negative	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
VIDEOGAMES_135_4	positive	Unbelievably great!!!
VIDEOGAMES_271_11	negative	Enemies get frozen in space, stuck in doorways, etc... It's so bad it's amateurish.
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
MUSIC_236_20	negative	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
VIDEOGAMES_124_1	negative	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
DVDS_178_23	neutral	I would have loved Darkness Falls if it had been a TV-movie.
VIDEOGAMES_129_7	neutral	Well, the character and monster models look pretty good, but the surrounding scenery is in serious need of a makeover.
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_120_8	negative	they're ruthless dictators with no ba11s.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
VIDEOGAMES_116_3	negative	To make matters worse, there are different ways to get through the intro screens.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
MUSIC_239_6	negative	Don't even waste your money.
VIDEOGAMES_288_21	positive	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
VIDEOGAMES_266_6	negative	You always had the same weapons, techniques, and the minions would always act the same!
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
VIDEOGAMES_267_3	negative	Because everybody loves microphone games!
ELECTRONICS_227_17	positive	It does all you ask of it and more.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
VIDEOGAMES_271_13	negative	Don't waste your money and try to play this game on the PC. It will frustrate you, anger you, and make you want to chuck the game in the trash.
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
DVDS_193_19	positive	Finally, it's no surprise that Hutton and Platt both turn in performances that are well worth watching.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
VIDEOGAMES_129_10	negative	But since you can only upgrade your Legions between levels, and it takes such a ridiculous amount of EXP to earn even the most basic of upgrades, it hardly seems worth it in the end.
BOOKS_156_15	negative	it's exactly as South Park so poignantly described it.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_128_4	negative	It's just lacking something.
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
ELECTRONICS_78_3	positive	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
ELECTRONICS_224_9	negative	Getting it up for a Mac can take numerous hours and several phone calls to tech support.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
VIDEOGAMES_137_47	neutral	It's not a bad story, but it's really not a super exciting story.
MUSIC_260_3	positive	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
VIDEOGAMES_290_6	positive	It's like the teams in Sonic Heroes, only the system works better.
ELECTRONICS_227_5	positive	I must say this camera is AWESOME.
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
MUSIC_237_3	negative	This a forgettable collection that only the most dedicated of Moby fans will want to purchase.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_293_1	positive	It gets you strait where the first game left you - right into the action!
ELECTRONICS_216_10	negative	??? In room lighting it even chose 1 second exposures!
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
DVDS_191_3	negative	I knew right from the start that this was going to be over the top and not that interesting really.
ELECTRONICS_208_1	negative	The site totally sucks.
ELECTRONICS_75_2	positive	The picture quality is also very good and the main reason I bought it was the upscaling to match my TV - very impressive.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
ELECTRONICS_81_1	positive	Cons: None so far.
DVDS_181_12	negative	Why the alien has arrived and why the earth is in peril is a slap in the face compared to the classic motive set forth in the original.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
MUSIC_98_8	neutral	I had to crank my Velodyne WAAAAY up to match the SPLs of the 2 channel CD. Although the timbre of the instruments is really top notch on this release, Abraxas deserved a much better remastering than it received here.
ELECTRONICS_223_8	negative	And I have to call you back on long-distance, and then wait forever to the muzak and then hope that you might authorize a replacement, I asked.
VIDEOGAMES_127_30	negative	Smash Bros. games are expected to have a perfect replay value, but this one's longevity is INCREDIBLY low.
BOOKS_166_0	positive	We know why this book was honored with the 2005 Los Angeles Times Book Award for science/technical writing.
VIDEOGAMES_277_12	negative	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
VIDEOGAMES_271_6	negative	Miserable to play throughout.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
VIDEOGAMES_269_13	negative	it's an endless cycle that becomes annoying in the later sections when you face up against some extremely hard boss characters.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
VIDEOGAMES_281_0	negative	""Disappointing"" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
BOOKS_172_8	positive	The beginning of the book is a fascinating, funny look at how King's own career took flight.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
BOOKS_170_0	positive	The book is short in duration, easy to read, direct in nature, often with an aggitated voice and written as if a sermon or speech.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_79_1	positive	Looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_281_9	negative	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
BOOKS_146_13	negative	Jews lead an epic battle for the land that is rightfully theirs: just like the Germans did in 1939 against the 'evil' and 'inferior' Polish who were occupying 'their' land.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
ELECTRONICS_76_1	positive	The hardware itself is simple and well designed.
BOOKS_166_10	positive	Read this book and prepare to be moved and enlightened, just as you will be charmed by the people whose lives, livelihoods, and ways of knowing are as diverse as the environment itself.
BOOKS_168_21	positive	This is not one of those books you would simply read once and pass on.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
DVDS_189_4	neutral	A quick mention for Francisco Ariza - a wonderful singer whose voice here sounds tired but still melodious with hints of the beauty of his vocal youth.
VIDEOGAMES_289_1	positive	Very addictive!
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
DVDS_181_6	negative	Great remakes are few and rare.
ELECTRONICS_209_4	negative	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
ELECTRONICS_220_1	negative	All of my portrait photos were displayed on their side.
BOOKS_167_5	positive	Perhaps even more current given the current economic crisis.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
VIDEOGAMES_281_6	negative	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
MUSIC_261_10	positive	And you should also enjoy it immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_144_4	positive	Huge cities within the world.
VIDEOGAMES_139_8	positive	definatley buy if you're a C&C fan
ELECTRONICS_80_6	positive	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
BOOKS_158_6	negative	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
VIDEOGAMES_134_44	negative	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
VIDEOGAMES_118_8	negative	way to go Bungie. Thats a shame, I had high hopes for this game.
BOOKS_170_21	positive	This book is useful for younger audiences.
VIDEOGAMES_121_1	negative	Two Worlds is crap and any person that thinks differently needs serious mental help.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
VIDEOGAMES_287_0	positive	If Final Fantasy VII is considered the pinnacle of console RPGs, then Baldur's Gate is most definetely considered the pinnacle of computer RPGs. This is simply one of the best series of games ever made, and any RPG fan simply cannot afford to not play it (and since the whole series is available for a tenner, you don't exactly have an excuse not to do so!)
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
MUSIC_89_1	negative	I did not like any of the songs.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
DVDS_177_0	negative	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
DVDS_194_7	neutral	Let's! Acting from Michael Chiklis (not anymore) was OK. I just didn't get into his character the thing.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
DVDS_195_9	neutral	Even so, ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES did make me appreciate the sheer number and variety of films Hudson made (westerns, war, Douglas Sirk melodramas, as well as the familiar, fluffy technicolor sex comedies with Doris Day).
ELECTRONICS_76_0	neutral	This product could use some work.
DVDS_193_6	neutral	The only problem I have is Faye Dunaway's really bad, hammy, mugging acting, and toward the end Boyle picks up some of the same style, but other than that I like it.
VIDEOGAMES_134_35	negative	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
MUSIC_90_1	negative	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
VIDEOGAMES_136_6	positive	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
VIDEOGAMES_278_2	negative	You can't aim at anything!
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_136_23	positive	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
VIDEOGAMES_125_6	positive	The 8 man tournament possible warrants this purchase.
MUSIC_240_6	neutral	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
VIDEOGAMES_127_9	negative	At that point it only holds up as one of those games that's only fun with other people(*cough*Mario Party*cough*). Sadly SSBB eventually loses it's fun factor when it comes to multiplayer, too.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
VIDEOGAMES_273_3	negative	He couldn't understand why there were no more levels to play.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
ELECTRONICS_72_24	negative	You must press the button down rather hard before it responds.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_137_16	negative	The village still exists, of course, but you can only go shopping there: the shopkeepers are only â€œpicturesâ€?, not persons, and you can't move around in the shop.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
DVDS_195_3	negative	If you can surmount that disappointment, it should be noted that the studio clips are mostly of extremely poor quality (as if photographed from a tv screen).
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_140_19	positive	No such thing in WarCraft 3. Granted, each faction has similarities.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
VIDEOGAMES_276_27	negative	The next time a company remakes a game for fans, THEY SHOULD ASK FIRST. BRING IT UP ON MORE FORUMS, WE WILL BE INTERESTED.
BOOKS_170_28	neutral	At least this book should reveal that there is much hidden behind the politcal propaganda machines which at last motivates a nations people to give up its young to the physical, moral and phsycological horrors of war in additional to the suffering and sacrifice of those left at home to worry and bear the costs in even the shortest of military conflicts.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
VIDEOGAMES_276_15	negative	Also with the illustration issue, the icons that represent the characters expressions when they're talking, were JUST FINE the way they were and I do not see how REDRAWING all of them enhanced the experience.
MUSIC_87_4	negative	I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
ELECTRONICS_209_0	neutral	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
ELECTRONICS_225_2	positive	It's cool looking, super quiet, and a very small form factor.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
MUSIC_253_7	negative	To me it was just not original.
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
VIDEOGAMES_137_38	negative	The spring and winter musics will get on your nerves when you hear them; they're slow!
DVDS_185_7	negative	I'm to old to waste time.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
BOOKS_170_25	positive	I recomend this book among others such as ""Collateral Damage"" by Chris Hodges to all those who are inspired by patriotic propaganda to join the armed uniformed services.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
VIDEOGAMES_279_8	positive	On the gameplay side, the difficulty settings allow for pretty good challenge between teams.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
VIDEOGAMES_134_13	neutral	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
VIDEOGAMES_266_0	neutral	At first it was ok.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
VIDEOGAMES_134_58	negative	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
MUSIC_109_7	positive	The recording is wonderfully clean and complete with crystal clear feedback.
VIDEOGAMES_276_21	positive	I do like finally having Cornet on the cover.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
BOOKS_154_2	negative	He has aparently been in Vietnam which is great, but being a soldier doesn't make you a poet.
VIDEOGAMES_124_3	negative	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
VIDEOGAMES_137_34	negative	Still, as good they may be, the cows really look bad in this game.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
BOOKS_170_50	positive	I would say this book encourages.
VIDEOGAMES_121_6	negative	STAY AWAY FROM TWO WORLDS...DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
BOOKS_164_1	negative	I was EXTREMELY disappointed when he didn't name any of them.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
BOOKS_156_13	negative	But really...
MUSIC_87_0	negative	I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet.
VIDEOGAMES_137_0	negative	I'ma really huge Harvest Moon fan, but this one really disappointed me.
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
VIDEOGAMES_134_65	neutral	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
MUSIC_252_16	neutral	The album does have several good offerings, mostly on the uptempo numbers, but Eric should now go back to square one and get in touch with his inner Johnson.
MUSIC_108_4	positive	Their shows are great too!
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
MUSIC_251_6	positive	If you like militaristic dnb and are unfamiliar with all of Dieselboy's other works, you'll love this album.
DVDS_200_0	positive	THE TV SET (2007) *** David Duchovny, Sigourney Weaver, Ioan Gruffudd, Judy Greer, Fran Kranz, Lindsay Sloane, Justine Bateman, Lucy Davis, Willie Garson, MC Gainey, Philip Baker Hall, Andrea Martin. Tart Satire of TV; Duchovny Gives Great Deadpan Jake Kasdan's latest satire, ""THE TV SET"", is a pitch perfect , dead-on depiction of the myopic vision of American television which has become a vast wasteland of so-called 'reality' shows and mean-spirited game shows when in essence, the true pillars of its foundation, the scripted format is on the wane.
VIDEOGAMES_287_3	positive	-Make your own unique character from scratch in Baldur's Gate 1, and then after completing the first game, import them into Baldur's Gate 2 for true continuity and continue the saga.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
ELECTRONICS_73_16	negative	I called Sony again, and again the first agent said it was already sent, then after I explained it hadn't arrived I was transferred to the second department, which again confirmed it hadn't been sent out yet.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
ELECTRONICS_79_0	positive	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
DVDS_197_10	positive	His entrance alone is worth the price of admission in a seersucker suit (trousers altered to shorts for the humid climes) and a panama hat.
MUSIC_263_1	positive	I love their cd and I love them.
BOOKS_153_14	neutral	Please. But it was short and easy to skim the worst parts, and there were a couple of chuckles.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
DVDS_204_11	positive	Filmmaker Lodge Kerrigan has created a truly amazing, deeply felt emotional roller coaster exploring the inner corridors of mental health, family values and the human condition that he touched base on a similar theme in his stunning debut in 1994 with ""CLEAN, SHAVEN"" featuring a schizophrenic (character actor Peter Greene, best known as the racist/rapist doomed Zed in ""PULP FICTION"") attempting to keep his demons at bay in his search for a daughter he never met.
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_140_13	neutral	You really spend most of your micro-management on the heroes (you usually have 2 at a time, which makes the game just micro-intensive enough to be hard, but not so much as too make it frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_134_24	negative	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
ELECTRONICS_227_19	positive	But it does comes close if you know what you're doing!
MUSIC_259_6	positive	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
MUSIC_260_6	positive	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_266_7	negative	They all just staggered back when they died and always seemed to come out of nowhere!
VIDEOGAMES_276_2	negative	... Cons: No original illustrations to find.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
VIDEOGAMES_123_5	negative	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
VIDEOGAMES_123_0	negative	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
VIDEOGAMES_272_16	negative	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
DVDS_204_13	positive	The real miracle is Lewis who in a perfect world would be a natural bet for a Best Actor nod (and win) but this independent film is small in scale (and distribution so far despite it being executive produced by acclaimed filmmaker Steven Soderbergh).
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
ELECTRONICS_229_3	positive	I am shocked how good the picture is even when the broadband is slow.
MUSIC_105_3	positive	All the songs show the feelings and oppinions of chad, shae and ofcorse the wonderfull pharell williams.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
VIDEOGAMES_279_7	negative	they just don't seem to blend as well as I had hoped.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
VIDEOGAMES_269_6	negative	Normally I don't have problems with simple stories, but when combined with the monotony of the quest, you'd think they would have written a better story, to keep you interested.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
DVDS_204_20	neutral	Keep the audience guessing as one would after instilling one's interest, concern and want to protect William Keane in his quest: forgiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
MUSIC_109_8	positive	Moon's cymbals are transparent...his drumwork really stands out on this release.
VIDEOGAMES_141_0	positive	""Almost, but not quite"" So here's my review of Mercenaries 2 World in Flames review for the Xbox 360. I enjoyed this game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
MUSIC_256_6	positive	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
ELECTRONICS_224_12	positive	It's fast, printer high quality black and whites, and the scan function is fine if you're not doing too many sheets at once.
MUSIC_252_12	negative	What a disappointment!!
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
VIDEOGAMES_269_23	negative	Pick up FFA or FFL3 for halfway decent Final Fantasy games on the GB. Final Comments: I was stuck with this game and Mario Golf being my only entertainment on a cross country trip (I lost 4-5 of my GBC/GB games in a hotel room) and every time I tried to stomach through this game, I kept running back to Mario Golf. Please, if you want a good game, get anything but this.
ELECTRONICS_210_3	negative	The steps to reach the file transfer are too complex and non exhistent(sp?).I found no company ph number on any of the product literature, the web site or yellow pages.com.
VIDEOGAMES_127_18	neutral	Eye Candy. ~Sound: 7/10~ While the sound is nothing special, it doesn't hurt my ears.
MUSIC_263_4	positive	So people don t like them cause of that but they are good and their cd is good.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
ELECTRONICS_218_2	positive	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
MUSIC_103_13	positive	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
VIDEOGAMES_129_8	neutral	Throughout most of the game, you'll be surrounded by drab castle walls (which is forgivable, given the game's setting), and many shades of gray (or black, should you stick around long enough to venture into the later levels).
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
VIDEOGAMES_280_3	negative	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_271_7	negative	The graphics are crummy, and despite having crossfired graphics cards (HD4870s).
MUSIC_263_2	positive	They are cute and they can sing and dance.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_134_37	negative	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_125_17	negative	I haven't completed legend mode(defend the belt 7 times) but after that I think it will collect dust.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
DVDS_191_6	negative	These are just icons symbolising that Andy and Larry has opened the Great Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Religion and just cramed it all together.
ELECTRONICS_218_1	positive	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
VIDEOGAMES_291_25	positive	They do Simple & Clean at the end!
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
ELECTRONICS_79_7	positive	No problems what so ever.
MUSIC_95_10	neutral	I think next time the bass should be a little bit more outside, because it just sounds like he doesn't move around at all.
MUSIC_112_6	neutral	""Here We Go Again"" demonstrates that not all of Paramore is just vocals and catchy choruses.
DVDS_185_0	neutral	You would like to think a vast array of stars brought together in a romantic film such as this would work but....whaddaya know, great cast given a tragically bad (and I mean very bad) script.
DVDS_191_22	neutral	A think that unfortunally didn't translate too-well into the world of The Matrix. Another good thing about this film was the CGI that was actually out-dated but that fit perfectly into the premise of the film and didn't make things worse like they did in Star Wars II: Attack of the CGI-Clones. And of course, a spoiler ending.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
ELECTRONICS_85_10	positive	It even brackets.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
MUSIC_99_3	negative	But three in a bed make ""country music,"" and it tastes nothing like Bragg or Guthrie--maybe more Wilco than Willie Nelson. What do I mean?
MUSIC_101_2	neutral	This will give you an insight into the style and manner of The Smiths but it all seems very lacking.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
MUSIC_112_11	neutral	""Whoa"" has the most simplistic lyrics of any song on the album, but it'll definitely be fun to dance along to at shows.
ELECTRONICS_219_1	positive	Within its limitations it's excellent, interacting automatically with other apps (like iCal and Address Book) on the Mac. It also simplifies database use in general for those of us intimidated by full FileMaker.
ELECTRONICS_234_2	neutral	Ocassionaly disconnects and then reconnects.
MUSIC_238_1	negative	Maybe this was a bit harsh, but after the grueling hour I spent trying to find quality music in this hip-hop/pop trash, maybe it wasn't punishment enough.
DVDS_205_15	positive	The two leads are funny, fast-witted â€“ like a modern day Hope & Crosby with cool to spare and do the best work they've both done in recent memory.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
DVDS_194_3	negative	Jessica alba wasn't all that great though.
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
DVDS_178_7	negative	I mean, are they the only two people in the world who has lost their last baby-tooth?
VIDEOGAMES_125_18	negative	I can't recommend this game even if you are a big UFC fan like myself.
BOOKS_146_3	negative	Let me substantiate my claim: 1. It is historically inaccurate.
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
BOOKS_174_3	positive	My husband and I have read several marriage books over the years...some good, some bad, and one so terrible that Andy actually threw it across the bedroom into the trashcan...but Love and Respect is our favorite, by far.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
MUSIC_99_5	neutral	I miss the quirk of Bragg, although he does wonders with Guthrie.
ELECTRONICS_211_0	neutral	Pros: seems to work okay so far Cons: ENCRYPTION KEY IN PLAIN TEXT If you get this product, do NOT install the client.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
BOOKS_158_1	positive	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
ELECTRONICS_72_23	negative	This is probably true for other cameras, but with the Gateway camera it is particularly troublesome because the shutter button seems to lack sensitivity.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
VIDEOGAMES_142_6	positive	Experience the intensity and exhilaration of professional wrestling as you step onto the mat to fight the most brutal band of brawlers around.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
BOOKS_167_4	positive	It's amazing that a book written a little more than two decades ago can still be relevant and current.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
ELECTRONICS_74_3	neutral	None of this is to say that the Terk FDTV2A is bad antenna, because it's not, but it's certainly no better than other things out there on the market.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
VIDEOGAMES_292_8	positive	The gameplay is very, very good.
BOOKS_168_15	neutral	While a great overview, I think it could have gone a little deeper.
VIDEOGAMES_125_19	neutral	We will have to wait for a new version of UFC to come out.
BOOKS_172_10	positive	King saves the most harrowing prose for the book's closing chapter, where he describes in detail the accident that almost took his life, and the role his writing has played in his recovery.
VIDEOGAMES_126_19	negative	Another thing is the US version of this game is missing 8 characters, a few jutsu's and 1 stage.
VIDEOGAMES_276_26	neutral	All the original character sprites are still here, as well as a beastiary and character display, but both of these additions do not qualify for forgetting about all the other subtle features that made the original game so popular for the so few of us that played it.
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
BOOKS_158_10	neutral	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
VIDEOGAMES_140_26	positive	But don't get me wrong, the graphics on this game are incredible, I've ran them with a GeForce4 TI 4200 128 mb on high everything it was very impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_130_2	negative	The Aiming feature has yet to be desired however.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
VIDEOGAMES_144_3	positive	A lot of humor and interesting quests if you take time to read them.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_287_2	positive	I haven't seen a bargain like that for a while.
MUSIC_100_1	positive	I still love ""And Then There Was Silence.""
ELECTRONICS_220_4	negative	The auto-fit option flattens standard photos quite a lot, while the other options leave space on either side of the photo.
ELECTRONICS_218_6	negative	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_122_16	neutral	This is probably not the definitive WW2 grunt game you were lookin' for.
VIDEOGAMES_125_12	neutral	Don't get me started on why they would speed up the in game clock???
ELECTRONICS_85_21	neutral	A full heavy day of shooting will drain the battery, but I can live with that.
VIDEOGAMES_132_9	negative	The game has very blocky graphics bringing down its overall appeal.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_277_16	neutral	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
BOOKS_149_11	negative	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
VIDEOGAMES_279_16	negative	Finally, I have to give this game such a low value rating because all you are getting for a $60 game is a single game mode, basic season mode, online play, and create a player...
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
MUSIC_244_4	negative	It's almost like she's saying, ""I'm Beyonce, I'm amazing, and people will jump on anything I create, so why even make an attempt.""
VIDEOGAMES_134_69	negative	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
BOOKS_145_0	negative	I was a first year AP US teacher when I purchased this book and another by the Princeton Review. Both books are intended to be complete resources for reviewing for the AP Exam, but the Princeton Review is substantially better in all areas.
VIDEOGAMES_285_16	neutral	Replay Value: 6/10 Depends....You might go on multi player and play with absolutely nobody....I can't remember a time when anybody actually played multiplayer.....Anyways....If you wait a few years and play it again...Or you might just wanna kill some cowboys in western clint eastwood style....
ELECTRONICS_224_3	neutral	Leopard works fine, with the exception of faxing from the computer which I found impossible to get working, even after several hours on the phone with Canon tech support.
VIDEOGAMES_144_0	positive	The Good: it's a fun co-op game & SP game (never tried PvP).
VIDEOGAMES_282_10	positive	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
BOOKS_172_2	positive	King speaks authoritatively on his subject - as well he should, with volume after volume of best-selling fiction to his credit.
VIDEOGAMES_282_15	positive	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
MUSIC_241_0	negative	If this CD is ""remastered"", it certainly was not from the 1st generation, multi-track session tapes.
BOOKS_168_16	negative	* I wish there would have been more talk of the archaeological records.
DVDS_204_3	positive	Months have passed and apparently Keane has been plagued by his absolute guilt in allowing her to be taken from him that it has affected (or possibly triggered) a panicky, inner voice that speaks to him (or more accurately has him speaking aloud to himself either calming his fear or invoking more paranoia) as he wanders seemingly aimless in the unforgiving way station (a perfect metaphor for his situation), replete with a tattered news clipping about his missing daughter that he waves to unsuspecting passersby and pedestrians alike milling about their daily chores of going back and forth to work or another destination.
DVDS_192_13	negative	Sadly though, the negative aspects of AV are too glaring to ignore.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_130_6	positive	This game did have one feature i thought was awesome and it was the Lethality of the ""Knife"" quickly hitting the right trigger button at the right time would do an instant execute on any soldier and almost any dinosaur(up to the raptor).
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
VIDEOGAMES_285_15	negative	Though...After spending some time in a level with pretty much the same exact music, it gets boring...and annoying...and after the whole game, the same tracks are used in atleast four different levels...I think....Maybe it's the same track in every level...
VIDEOGAMES_117_18	negative	I hear they are releasing new modes, but who cares when the game play is this bad.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
VIDEOGAMES_137_9	negative	In this game, they took off all that fun stuff that made the game somehow special.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_259_0	positive	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
ELECTRONICS_207_3	positive	The material is durable and the bag looks good.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
ELECTRONICS_213_8	negative	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
VIDEOGAMES_134_66	negative	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_276_9	negative	I was certainly one of the most excited fans out there when I heard this game was going to DS, and the disappointment with all the features they left out of this game was appalling.
MUSIC_95_8	negative	Oh my gosh, and he always is mixing it up, from hi hat to ride cymbal, dang, it's so chopped I don't even know what kind of meat he is flavoring!!!
VIDEOGAMES_271_8	negative	I can't get decent frames no matter what.
VIDEOGAMES_285_7	positive	Better than most FPS (exception; BLOOD!)
MUSIC_99_6	neutral	I miss the quirk of Wilco. Instead, what we get here is an album of talented mass appeal.
MUSIC_94_8	negative	but i've never been impressed with DM, in the slightest...
ELECTRONICS_212_2	negative	Support has head up rectum - after informing them I uninstalled the program but the program never fully uninstalled, I was informed that I must have done something wrong.
DVDS_177_12	negative	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
ELECTRONICS_72_21	negative	The camera has a cover for the ports for the AC adapter and USB cable--this cover is very flimsy plastic, and I think it's only a matter of time before it breaks off.
VIDEOGAMES_269_16	negative	Normally, I don't complain about music, but in most games, the tunes are at least halfway decent, and you can continue playing without having to have the game on mute.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
MUSIC_108_5	positive	they actually sound like themselves wen they play live, not like som other bands who actually cant sing on stage.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
MUSIC_107_9	positive	I like this song...but it sounds like another song i know...i kant figure out who....
VIDEOGAMES_289_10	positive	The AI in this game is so strong and deeply complex, that it can actually make you feel stupid, which is probably not good for the gaming masses.
VIDEOGAMES_120_1	negative	That's about all it amounts too, and again on that same review it's more then likely due to buying out any possibility of competition.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
MUSIC_250_1	negative	Perhaps I set the bar too high, because I was sorely disappointed.
DVDS_188_27	neutral	Way better.
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
ELECTRONICS_234_4	positive	FM function allows you to play music on your phone through your car stereo.
ELECTRONICS_231_2	positive	HD tv channels look great, kinda upset that I didn't switch to LCD earlier but also glad because the price is SOOO reasonable.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
ELECTRONICS_232_11	neutral	Its colors are natural, not so over bright, yet its not faint or washed out.
MUSIC_98_4	negative	But the first thing you will notice on BLACK MAGIC WOMAN is that the .1 channel is almost non-existent.
VIDEOGAMES_134_41	negative	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
VIDEOGAMES_288_6	positive	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
ELECTRONICS_85_23	negative	As I keep it off when I'm not shooting it does take a bit longer than feels necessary to start up and auto-focus when I want shoot: maybe 3-4 secs or so.
DVDS_191_28	negative	This is just a complete disaster from top to bottom.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
DVDS_186_9	neutral	Orlando was good, reason I bought the DVD. I would never have bought the DVD if not for him.
MUSIC_239_5	negative	It's just rediculous that people would buy this crappy album.
DVDS_196_4	positive	Visionary film-making at its best.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
VIDEOGAMES_288_22	positive	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
ELECTRONICS_85_16	negative	It seems I may have used the flash accidentally once or twice (I keep it off) but if I depended on it I might be a little wary of its constant popping up as I'm sure its just a flimsy, plastic rack and pinion mechanism.
DVDS_204_15	positive	Sure he has all the staples of a 'crazy' role: talking to himself, sudden outbursts of near-violent rage, crying himself to sleep etc. but he never allows this to overtake the fact that William was a human being and that this tragic turn of events has him in a stranglehold only fueled by his desire to be free of this ongoing (and possibly self-afflicted) curse.
MUSIC_242_16	neutral	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
BOOKS_148_1	neutral	While I support the author's message, I found two mayor flaws in her writing.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
DVDS_187_6	negative	I left the movie theatre wodering what the hell happened when they were in there?
MUSIC_257_4	positive	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
VIDEOGAMES_136_38	positive	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
VIDEOGAMES_128_0	negative	""Disappointing"" This game ain't as good as the other 2D Sonic games This game is originally for the Sega CD then I found out this game was ported to PC. Even though I rarely play games on my PC I went to order this on EBay then I got it a days later then got around to playing it and I was dissapoint!
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
MUSIC_95_0	positive	Well, I think this band has some pretty fat salt licks, because, I don't know, it's pretty salty.
ELECTRONICS_85_4	neutral	Its JPEGs are hardly better than those from cameras costing less than half as much; the RAW images on the other hand are stunning.
MUSIC_86_16	negative	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
ELECTRONICS_227_0	positive	Pros: You already know the great features.
MUSIC_238_6	negative	""Signs"", co-written with Aaliyah's muse Missy Elliot, is a mess of nothing...driveling on about Astrology in a way that is neithor catchy nor creative.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_283_3	negative	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
DVDS_198_0	positive	BATMAN BEGINS (2005) **** Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Michael Caine, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe, Mark Boone Junior, Linus Roache. Excellent prequel 'origin' of The Dark Knight that adds fresh blood to a weakened franchise thanks largely to the unlikely POW!
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
ELECTRONICS_77_1	positive	Even picks up my neighbors networks.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
ELECTRONICS_223_6	negative	How could you not even try do get it to work on my current machine after spending so much time to get all the information out of me, I asked?
VIDEOGAMES_278_11	positive	The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is.
ELECTRONICS_218_10	positive	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
DVDS_201_6	negative	Also: don't be fooled; even though this was re-processed for a 3-D release there is practically no 3-D effects at all!
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
ELECTRONICS_208_7	negative	Don't believe the hype, there is no friendly nike online running community.
ELECTRONICS_85_7	positive	Very cool.
DVDS_187_22	positive	The maze scene will take you back in time to your old days of playing ""Dungeons and Dragons""...
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
MUSIC_247_2	neutral	Granted, they lost a lot with Roger's departure.
VIDEOGAMES_133_5	neutral	Playability: 2.5 / 5 it is pretty much the same as the first game.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
MUSIC_258_1	positive	If I could, I'd give Beethoven's Wig 2 ten or more stars!
DVDS_199_14	positive	The same can be said of this little gem of a film.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
VIDEOGAMES_136_4	negative	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
MUSIC_107_2	positive	1.I Realize - 5/5 stars.
DVDS_195_6	negative	I found such effects distracting and annoying.
ELECTRONICS_73_0	neutral	Pros: Many features, rapid rewind/fast-forward on VCR. ... Cons: Remote control somewhat difficult to learn to use, Sony service and exchange policies awful.
DVDS_181_18	neutral	She gave a stellar performance considering the poor script and direction of her character.
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
DVDS_203_2	positive	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
BOOKS_160_1	neutral	This I could stop reading easily but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
ELECTRONICS_213_0	positive	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
MUSIC_248_6	neutral	That raised my eyebrows, especially after it said full 12"" mixes on the front cover.
VIDEOGAMES_128_5	negative	Maybe it's the level designs' cheapness.
VIDEOGAMES_271_10	negative	Other problems include common clipping issues, buildings and terrain that pops up out of nowhere, and the worst skins I've seen on character models since 2004. The models are sloppy, robotic looking, and frankly ugly.
MUSIC_99_0	positive	Guthrie is a lyrical genius, of course.
VIDEOGAMES_292_6	positive	You decide which tournament you want to play, and where you wanna do that.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
VIDEOGAMES_287_14	negative	Generally the rewards for playing good are superior to taking an evil option (and sometimes there isn't a clear-cut evil option available at all).
DVDS_178_14	negative	Clearly the only goal of this PG horror was to attract children and depart them from their lunch-money by turning a childhood memory into a monster.
VIDEOGAMES_133_3	negative	The story is old, you gain all of your Brothers then you lose them, then you gain them back.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
VIDEOGAMES_265_5	neutral	Oter than that the sims are really cute but you also don't get a lot of clothes to choose from when you make your character.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
MUSIC_238_8	negative	The most annoying thing about this song is she keeps changing pitch, about every 5 words or so we're hearing a new tune.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
VIDEOGAMES_280_11	neutral	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
MUSIC_237_2	negative	Moby's ill advised exploration of disco gets even worse here.
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
VIDEOGAMES_270_4	negative	so again, i wouldnt advise any of u to buy it.
MUSIC_260_4	positive	While most people are only familiar with their third album, ""Under A Stone With No Inscription"", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
VIDEOGAMES_127_13	positive	In brief, the graphics are jaw-dropping good for a Wii game and will have you begging for more.
DVDS_191_20	positive	However the only smart thing was the BDSM-club, a sense of self-awareness, with all the leather and plastic and black, and oh so fetishly dressed actors.
MUSIC_242_4	negative	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
VIDEOGAMES_266_11	negative	The levels (the same thing over and over) The minions (they always acted the same, like they just had different skins or something) I wouldn't recommend buying this game for someone with experience, but if you just got a gamecube and the price is right ($5 or less) then maybe consider it.
VIDEOGAMES_122_7	negative	The rare gully and stone wall or rock is really your only option for ""real"" cover, but the game more or less expects you to use the haybails to hide behind when a German with an MP40 is shooting at you.
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
VIDEOGAMES_287_10	positive	-Unlike the original releases, every part of the series is just 1 DVD, which creates a lot less hassle.
ELECTRONICS_214_0	negative	This drive is embedded with Western Digital's SmartWare virtual CD that will ALWAYS and FOREVER boot to your Mac computer.
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
BOOKS_163_0	positive	Hop and Pop by Dr. Seuss is an interesting book.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
DVDS_193_16	positive	And one of the greatest lines ever: ""Good gosh how hard can it be?
MUSIC_254_22	negative	But it doesn't do much for me.
VIDEOGAMES_270_2	negative	i wouldnt really suggest buying it unless ur one of those who pick something up and can play 5 min of it and not play it for a long time.
MUSIC_95_6	negative	I don't know, I think he still is pretty putrid.
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
DVDS_193_9	positive	So with that in mind, you could look at it as one of the ""so bad it's good"" genre, and it does succeed on that level.
DVDS_176_0	negative	This one is actually the worst and the most sensless movie I have ever gone to a theater for.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
VIDEOGAMES_285_17	positive	Originality: 9/10 It's been a while since there's been a western-like FPS...actually....I can't remember any other...Well there is probably another Western FPS I've played, just this was the most memorable....
MUSIC_253_5	neutral	I wish this reunion included just the original members of Commissioned with the exception of Marvin Sapp, I do like Marvin Sapp he has brought flavor to the group.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
DVDS_191_8	negative	Lines like ""It's Latin, it means 'Know thy self'"", screams of un-intelligens, it was of course not Latin but ancient greek since the temple that said it was located in Delphi which is in Greece and not Italy. And no onward to the films.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
ELECTRONICS_220_6	neutral	Apart from this it seems to work fine.
VIDEOGAMES_128_2	positive	And it's cool how can travel from the past into the future.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
VIDEOGAMES_127_16	positive	All those combined make SSBB some great eye candy.
MUSIC_247_4	positive	Some elements still exist - ""Poles Apart"" and ""Coming Back To Life"" are strong efforts on this album.
VIDEOGAMES_286_3	positive	I love the assault rifle and the magnum and it was disappointing to see no assault rifle in Halo 2. They also replaced the magnum with a crappier version that is too weak.
VIDEOGAMES_269_8	negative	Gameplay : 1/10 As you journey around, you have to battle against other monsters, and buy weapons/armour, like any other game.
VIDEOGAMES_134_29	negative	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
BOOKS_153_3	negative	But fall short and aren't justified by argument or stories.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
ELECTRONICS_227_6	positive	Truly fantastic pictures.
BOOKS_162_7	negative	That's a fifth of the whole text!
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
BOOKS_166_3	positive	He can distill a century of mind-numbing bench science into a metaphor that his 10-year old can understand and that readers of all ages will appreciate.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
DVDS_192_6	positive	If you're a fan of the game you'll be happy to know that the movie recreates it's futuristic world to a tee.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
VIDEOGAMES_288_0	positive	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
MUSIC_112_0	neutral	Pros: catchiness, replayability, fun, energetic ... Cons: simplicity The Bottom Line: Buy It!
VIDEOGAMES_271_3	negative	The controls are lousy.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
VIDEOGAMES_287_5	positive	-Although the storyline does follow a set path, there are no restrictions in party members.
MUSIC_242_7	neutral	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
VIDEOGAMES_282_13	negative	They're all basically the same.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_214_4	negative	Can you tell that I am upset?!?
MUSIC_112_7	positive	Farro's guitar in this song is impressive and incredibly catchy, showing that this band will probably be hanging around the scene for awhile.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
ELECTRONICS_210_0	neutral	Strengths:looks cool ... Weaknesses:does not work and help menu has no solution.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
DVDS_186_0	positive	I liked this film.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
MUSIC_107_20	positive	Cliche, Best Inspiration and Evolution are my favorites.
VIDEOGAMES_140_20	positive	But the differences are much greater, and so well balanced that you see each faction represented among top players almost equally.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
VIDEOGAMES_140_9	negative	Not so much as your computer opponents AI when you play the single player games, that AI is weak.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
BOOKS_146_12	negative	This is a hand guide to obvious intellectual/emotional underpinnings of 'reverse-Nazism', in Exodus, all non-Jews are gutless traitors lacking in all attributes desirable to a human being, while the heroic, courageous, morally upright, (superior race!)
MUSIC_98_2	negative	I do not have the 2 channel SACD to use for comparison but I do have the regular remastered CD. This mix presents a wildly un-musical, psychedelic=like four channel guitar panning, throwing Carlos' guitar solos all over the place.
BOOKS_158_3	neutral	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
ELECTRONICS_216_9	negative	Even in relatively good lighting conditions, it chose horrifying exposure times like 1/6 of a second.
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_144_5	positive	If you liked Diablo and Titan Quest, I have no doubt you'll like this game.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
BOOKS_155_5	neutral	The main character is a computer who has all the characteristics of a sociopathic, spousal abusing monster with child-like innocence.
ELECTRONICS_78_11	positive	The P90 exceeds my expectations.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
MUSIC_252_14	negative	Sounds more like a rabid poodle on his trail rather than a hellhound!!
VIDEOGAMES_134_76	negative	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
DVDS_187_4	negative	The director sets the entire plot of the movie on about 10 minutes, the rest is just there to fill in the other 97 minutes.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
BOOKS_161_2	positive	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
ELECTRONICS_73_9	negative	They also refused to pay the postage for the return.
MUSIC_251_5	negative	Comeon. I think Dieselboy also should have included ""Submission"" and ""Barrier Breaks"" from the 12"" he did with Kaos. How could he you not include those 2 new, hot tracks on your album??
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
ELECTRONICS_81_7	positive	I would recommend it based on my experience.
VIDEOGAMES_120_3	negative	It was becoming too much for EA Sports to take with the annual humiliation from the up-start 2K Sports so they just bought the NFL rights to creating football video games.
VIDEOGAMES_117_1	neutral	This game has a few things going for it.
MUSIC_264_5	positive	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
VIDEOGAMES_115_5	negative	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.
VIDEOGAMES_127_31	negative	Thus bringing the score down.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
MUSIC_100_2	positive	To me, that's one of the most impressive songs BG have written, and that's saying something.
VIDEOGAMES_127_33	positive	Final thoughts: If your a die hard Smash Bros. fan, then you'll like this game.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_253_15	positive	The lyrics of Commissioned gets a 5 star rating because they didn't compromise their message with the world, their message was design to uplift your spirit so I must say thank you Commissioned for being a part of my childhood life, your music lives on and on!!
ELECTRONICS_209_1	negative	It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.
VIDEOGAMES_134_4	negative	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
DVDS_202_0	positive	FACTOTUM (2006) ***1/2 Matt Dillon, Lili Taylor, Marisa Tomei, Fisher Stevens, Didier Flamand, Karen Young, Adrienne Shelly. (Dir: Brent Hamer) Dynamite Dillon excels in Bukowski adaptation Matt Dillon, believe it or not, is one of the more versatile American actors around since his hey-day cocksure anti-heroes of the '80s (""Rumble Fish"", ""The Outsiders"") who can do it all, comedy (""There's Something About Mary"") and drama (""Crash"" which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination last year) and he continues his journeyman vocation with a humdinger performance running the gamut of human emotions.
DVDS_205_16	positive	Downey makes an affective coward/jerk/good-hearted schnook while Kilmer coasts on his pretty boy charms with a nod to straight men like Bud Abbott and Dean Martin â€“ street smarts and flair to spare.
VIDEOGAMES_137_13	negative	This is what gives Harvest Moon games a little something special, and they took it all off!
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
ELECTRONICS_85_15	negative	While that could be overlooked in a Happy Meal toy, this is a $400 camera.
DVDS_198_3	positive	A sound cast of international bravado (Caine as Alfred, the butler, Wayne's manservant/father figure, adds a dash of subtle observations and common sense; Freeman as Wayne Enterprises' best kept secret displaying the varying degrees of know-how and Bat-phenalia; Oldman as a young (soon-to-be Commissioner) Jim Gordon â€“ apparently the only honest cop on the force has a few nice subtle moments of awe and cunning; silky Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane AKA The Scarecrow; Wilkinson as ganglord Carmine Falcone affecting a New Yorkese dialect tuff guy demeanor; Hauer as a reptilian board chairman of Wayne's empire with oily ease); sterling production design by Nathan Crowley envisioning Gotham City as ""New York on steroids"", the dank cinematography by Wally Pfister, and reimagining of the stealthy costumed Caped Crusader by designer Lindy Hemming combine for a robust display of ingenuity.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
DVDS_197_6	positive	Garcia does an admirable job in capturing the flavor of the late 1950s look of the imbroglio-to-be with an elegant production design created by Waldemar Kalinowski and gorgeous cinematography by Emmanuel Kadosh that does justice to his ideal yet struggling nation under fire.
DVDS_180_3	negative	Eddie Murphy's latest and now this...""Hannibal meets Homer Simpson"".
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
VIDEOGAMES_137_27	positive	Control: I can't say they're bad; in fact they're pretty easy to use, if only you could carry more things, but they're really good!
DVDS_205_2	positive	Shane Black is back in a big way.
MUSIC_249_4	neutral	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
MUSIC_101_3	negative	The main problem was that none of the songs were being performed live.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
DVDS_200_6	positive	Kasdan layers everything with a touch of stinging wit, caustic dialogue, and unbelievable accuracy of how some people truly are so incredibly dense to the matters of the creative process it's a true wonder how the hell they got so far (let alone dressed themselves in the morning and made the effort at a daily life!)
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
VIDEOGAMES_125_14	neutral	I always feel satisfied after ground and pounding an opponent to victory but the fighting is still rather simple and not much else goes on.
VIDEOGAMES_134_49	positive	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
VIDEOGAMES_271_9	negative	I easily get 40-50 frames a second on very high in Crysis, and Saints Row pulls an awful 20-27 despite having inferior graphics.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_239_1	negative	Not many of the songs grabbed my attention, his voice gets real annoying after a while too.
MUSIC_89_5	negative	don't buy this cd it is a waste of good money
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
VIDEOGAMES_118_1	neutral	Fire Fight is cool if you like horde in Gears of War. Other than that though this game sucks.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
VIDEOGAMES_121_4	negative	I don't think the creators could have done a worse job and honestly I hope SouthPeak doesn't get the option to make any more games.
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
MUSIC_264_9	positive	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
DVDS_188_28	neutral	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
ELECTRONICS_74_2	neutral	What I can tell, you, however, is that this antenna doesn't seem to pick up any more channels than the other antennas I've tried, the RCA ANT1500 (returned to retail store) or Amplified Monoprice Antenna (currently in guest room).
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
DVDS_192_20	negative	Adding insult to injury, staple characters of the game such as Barret and antagonist Sephiroth are given little screen time.
VIDEOGAMES_141_1	negative	I'll admit the plotline sucked, the guns feel weak, and the worlds kind of boring.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
VIDEOGAMES_291_5	positive	The intro has PS2 graphics!
ELECTRONICS_83_3	positive	Greatest TV I have ever had!
VIDEOGAMES_129_2	negative	Well, let's see...For starters, the pacing of the game is very uneven.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
ELECTRONICS_213_4	negative	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
VIDEOGAMES_133_4	neutral	Boring, give us something new, the Mu part was interesting, and the fact you can play two games, Zerker and Saurian, nice touch.
VIDEOGAMES_139_6	negative	Value Seems very long, but the campain can get a bit boring, those videos really get on your nerves aswell.
MUSIC_252_5	neutral	""32-20 Blues,"" ""If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,"" and ""Me and The Devil Blues"" are just about the only other good interpretations offered here.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
MUSIC_253_2	positive	I must say this album really grew on me when I saw the DVD. In my books the music gets a 5 star rating, for sure it was off the chain.
MUSIC_252_4	positive	Billy Preston's tinkling piano and Jerry Portnoy's wonderful harp provide the musical highpoints.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
ELECTRONICS_211_6	neutral	Other than that, it seems to work okay, so far.
VIDEOGAMES_291_20	positive	In KH do you know, when you start, the opening scene looks AWESOME and realistic, and the same for the end?
MUSIC_241_4	negative	In this day and age of today's advanced digital technology, a golden opportunity to digitally remix and remaster some of the greatest music of the '60s, was missed.
MUSIC_259_9	positive	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how ""The Passion of Christ"" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended
VIDEOGAMES_294_5	positive	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
MUSIC_107_13	positive	nice music, background beats...
VIDEOGAMES_124_7	negative	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
MUSIC_250_3	neutral	The singers have wonderfully clear and resonant voices and take great care and precision in delivering every note perfectly, to the effect that the passion is never allowed to seep through.
DVDS_205_5	positive	Well Black took a self-imposed sabbatical (ie he was considered a pariah and he had a near mental breakdown due to depression) and managed to get his s*%% together to make a fine comeback in this his directorial debut that delivers just what the smart-ass title suggests not so subtly.
ELECTRONICS_215_6	negative	Two things I don't like....1)the headset isn't very comfortable for longer calls--my ear starts to hurt if it's in for more than a few minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
BOOKS_168_3	positive	While I read the book from cover-to-cover, it would work best as a resource for anyone studying the OT. Kevin Vanhoozer sets the tone of the book early by writing a masterful introduction.
VIDEOGAMES_118_0	negative	This was a ripoff.
DVDS_200_2	neutral	The filmmaker cut his teeth on TV including the much critically lauded, hastily dispatched ""Freaks & Geeks, that his insider voice is on full display for biting the hand that fed him and for rubbing its ilk in the mess its created.
MUSIC_261_7	positive	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider ""Hyperborea"" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
DVDS_188_32	neutral	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.
BOOKS_157_5	negative	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
VIDEOGAMES_136_28	positive	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
VIDEOGAMES_130_3	negative	I found the cross hairs a little too sensitive and the amount of time between checkpoints too long.
MUSIC_92_5	negative	The band sounds bored silly on this album and it shows.
BOOKS_166_7	positive	In his book, he captivates us by telling us what his ""characters"" know how to do.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
VIDEOGAMES_127_32	negative	Way down.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
MUSIC_249_3	neutral	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is ""post-punk"" or ""dream-scape 80s refresh"" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
BOOKS_170_2	positive	Regardless the era, the subject matter is relevant (Corporate crime).
ELECTRONICS_85_19	neutral	Other reviewers have criticized the battery life...this hasn't been much of an issue for me.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
DVDS_199_9	positive	To make matters worse he runs into an old colleague, Elliot Litvak (an unkempt and funny Dunne) who is downward spiraling fast after a devastating debacle in the form of his last attempt at a play that was skewered by the hated Schwimmer to the point Litvak can quote chapter and verse of the bilious critique that has him fixated to the extent of dementia.
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_279_13	negative	Maybe next year or the version for the PS3 will be what Live gamers were expecting from a next generation title.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
BOOKS_148_5	negative	It's not all about ME!
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
DVDS_179_5	negative	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
BOOKS_150_3	negative	How deeply disturbing that a book such as this could be published by a respectable publisher, endorsed by anthropologists, and even be nominated for a National Book Award. If Tierney was just honestly presenting evidence of wrongdoing, that would be fine.
BOOKS_170_51	positive	This book is recommendable to all if not quit a 'must read' and worthy of referencing current political, business and military discussions.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
VIDEOGAMES_123_2	neutral	It's a mindless sort of fun.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
ELECTRONICS_213_6	negative	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
DVDS_193_12	positive	For example: One of my favorite literary devices is the ""buddy thing,"" which is an entertainment staple: Laurel and Hardy, Skipper and Gilligan, Kip and friend in Bosom Buddies, Balky and Larry in ""Perfect Strangers,"" etc. This movie features that, but in four directions: Hutton and his boss, Hutton and his buddy (Webber), Hutton and his rival (Platt), Hutton and Boyle. Lots of fun there.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
MUSIC_102_2	positive	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
DVDS_176_3	negative	I was extremely disappointed.
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
VIDEOGAMES_122_12	positive	The sound effects are great and accurate, making it seem like you're in a movie (the rip rip rip of the MG42 is what it should be -- alarming).
VIDEOGAMES_278_13	negative	RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.
MUSIC_264_10	positive	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
VIDEOGAMES_275_7	negative	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
MUSIC_106_7	positive	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.
MUSIC_112_19	positive	I think, if you give this band a couple years, they have a chance to be real heavyweights in the emo/pop-rock scene, and will be selling out large venues soon.
ELECTRONICS_215_9	neutral	Would I buy it again?
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_3	negative	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_291_22	positive	The normal graphics are good too.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
ELECTRONICS_224_14	neutral	A great printer for Windows, much less so for Macs. Since I specifically bought it to work with Macs, the fact that it doesn't support them well is very frustrating and may lead me to return this printer for a different brand--I hear Brother printers work a lot better with Mac hardware so I might give them a try.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
ELECTRONICS_80_7	positive	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
BOOKS_146_8	negative	The 100+ positive reviews of this book mortified me.
VIDEOGAMES_133_6	negative	Re-playability 1/5 After the credits the only thing to do is a few side-quests that only help with bragging rights.
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
VIDEOGAMES_127_8	negative	When playing alone, SSBB loses it's value quickly.
MUSIC_106_3	positive	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
VIDEOGAMES_129_6	negative	The graphics don't do this game justice, either.
VIDEOGAMES_277_2	negative	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
VIDEOGAMES_288_23	positive	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
MUSIC_86_10	neutral	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
MUSIC_91_3	neutral	The music they play is good, they have an edge, but I think they need to get a new lead singer/songwriter.
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
MUSIC_114_5	neutral	Sixties-wise, it has all the right elements: layered guitars, reverb, echo, jangle, phasing and harmonies.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
ELECTRONICS_219_3	negative	Makes it tough for use in a mixed environment.
VIDEOGAMES_292_4	positive	The graphs are very, very good for good 'ol Xbox. You really have the feeling that you self are snowboarding on top of that big, fat mountain.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
VIDEOGAMES_288_25	positive	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
ELECTRONICS_77_0	positive	Pros: Works excellent in my Dell 8100 using XP Home. My wireless router is in the basement and it works fantastic everywhere in my house (no dead spots even on 2nd story).
BOOKS_168_10	positive	* The book is well researched.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
DVDS_187_1	neutral	There is a great storyline that could have been used the the fullest, yet I was really disappointed with the film itself.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_293_0	positive	NG2 doesn't disapoint!
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
MUSIC_249_8	positive	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_134_47	neutral	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
DVDS_204_14	positive	Lewis, who shined in HBO's mini-series ""BAND OF BROTHERS"" and was the best thing in ""DREAMCATCHER"", a British actor who uncannily channels an American accent every time, is an underrated thespian who truly gives a stunning, shocking and ultimately sympathetic performance.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_280_5	negative	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
VIDEOGAMES_126_6	negative	This game is a very dumbed down version of that game (which also features Naruto as a playable character) you only attack with ONE button making it a easy game to play.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_279_6	negative	The only problem I have with anything graphical are some of the transitions between animations in the game...
BOOKS_174_5	positive	Biblical sense.
ELECTRONICS_230_9	negative	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
VIDEOGAMES_122_1	negative	The major drawback to the game is actually one of the simpler things: You are forced to use bulletproof wooden fences (huh?), haybails, and tin barrels as legitimate cover for yourself and your squad.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
VIDEOGAMES_136_12	neutral	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
ELECTRONICS_226_0	positive	This computer is amazing!!
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
MUSIC_242_6	negative	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_122_3	negative	Ridiculous stuff.
VIDEOGAMES_281_7	negative	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
MUSIC_243_5	negative	I saw Brad at the Oprey way back when, and I must say I knew he would be a star, but this album is sooo lack-luster, very disappointing.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
ELECTRONICS_75_1	neutral	Setting it up seemed relatively straight forward and I've managed to record several times onto the hard drive without any problems.
VIDEOGAMES_271_0	negative	This is the worst port I've played in a long time.
MUSIC_110_4	positive	The performances are completely polished.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
BOOKS_145_7	negative	Better yet, get yourself the Princeton Review book!
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
MUSIC_237_1	negative	In this case, Last Night was a pretty poor effort by Moby standards, and this remix collection is miles away from the brilliance of Play or the solidly constructed Hotel. Relatively bad songs remixed are still relatively bad songs.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
ELECTRONICS_212_5	negative	Would NOT recommend this or any other logitech product now.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
ELECTRONICS_83_0	positive	Pros: The picture and sound.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
VIDEOGAMES_137_32	positive	Everything is well colored.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
VIDEOGAMES_281_13	negative	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
MUSIC_260_8	positive	The third song, ""Under Azure Skies"", deserves a paragraph of its own.
VIDEOGAMES_272_11	negative	No...not at all.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
MUSIC_110_5	positive	True these all come from 78 RPM sources but they are as good as it gets.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
BOOKS_167_1	positive	The book tells one how to ""get paid"" in a spiritual way.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
VIDEOGAMES_267_6	negative	-Amazingly pointless, annoying new game mechanics!
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
VIDEOGAMES_122_15	neutral	The game doesn't offer large, open terrain, but levels consisting more or less of corridor-like fields for you to navigate, much like Call Of Duty. That normally isn't a problem when it is disguised well, but regardless, it gets old.
MUSIC_237_4	negative	1.5/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
