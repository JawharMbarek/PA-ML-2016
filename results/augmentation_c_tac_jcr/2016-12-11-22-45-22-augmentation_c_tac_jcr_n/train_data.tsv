DVDS_177_7	negative	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
VIDEOGAMES_134_26	negative	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
VIDEOGAMES_124_19	negative	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
VIDEOGAMES_279_15	positive	The arenas feel alive and watching the game and the start screen is great.
ELECTRONICS_207_6	negative	(Careful handled and not over loaded).The bag is unusable and worthless without them....
MUSIC_86_7	positive	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
ELECTRONICS_74_11	negative	If you needed to lengthen the coaxial cable, you could use a female-to-female barrel connector, but I assume you would start degrading your signal at some point.
DVDS_199_11	positive	Filmmaker Hoffman does a yeoman-like job in getting fine quality performances from his gifted ensemble and in his star, Keaton gets a few juicy yet low-key turns as well balancing the tension that is leading to a possible fall-out.
ELECTRONICS_207_1	positive	Small, but roomy inside.
VIDEOGAMES_130_0	positive	""Check your bargain bin"" The Game play of this game was done very well.
BOOKS_154_0	neutral	I read it and quite frankly I'm less than impressed.
BOOKS_146_6	negative	2. The shallowness of the characters made me cringe.
DVDS_192_12	positive	Being a big fan of Nobuo Uematsu, I was overall pleased with his work in this movie.
ELECTRONICS_85_20	neutral	I keep the camera off between shots, have the LCD turned down a bit, rarely use the movie mode and flash, so I can get perhaps three days of casual shooting off a single charge.
VIDEOGAMES_136_9	neutral	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
VIDEOGAMES_284_3	negative	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
VIDEOGAMES_141_14	negative	You can barely hit guys across the streets with a M4. Racing missions are just annoying.
ELECTRONICS_217_5	negative	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
VIDEOGAMES_139_0	neutral	""Best in series"" Gameplay Very fun, but it can get a bit tedious starting all over again, but thats what RTS's are all about isn't it?
BOOKS_153_10	negative	Narrator is impossible to sympathize with; he chased money and worldly success and is now reconsidering.
ELECTRONICS_82_3	positive	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
MUSIC_103_7	negative	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply ""starts"".
BOOKS_157_7	negative	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
MUSIC_95_5	negative	But for some reason it sounds like he is playing is guitar upside down.
ELECTRONICS_80_1	negative	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
VIDEOGAMES_292_1	positive	You can customize this character in many outrageous ways.
DVDS_191_5	negative	The names are the worst part of these films, ""The Logos"", ""The Hammer"", ""Smith"", ""Morpheus"", ""Trinity"" and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_269_0	negative	Very rarely do you come across a game like this, and I'm extremely glad for this.
VIDEOGAMES_275_12	negative	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
ELECTRONICS_223_1	negative	The bad - on my Windows XP machine, with not much software installed and generally well-maintained, the software failed to install the drivers properly.
VIDEOGAMES_140_1	positive	It is NOT a sequel to Starcraft, and it is NOT an AoE rip-off either.
MUSIC_97_3	positive	Nostalgic Cut: White Bird (yup.
VIDEOGAMES_278_14	negative	If you haven't played RE1 you're not missing much at all.
VIDEOGAMES_266_8	negative	Then the bosses weren't even historically accurate, and it didn't take a historian to figure that out!
DVDS_202_6	positive	Newcomer Hamer allows his actors plenty of room in the seemingly improvisatory sequences of dry humor sprinkled out (he co-adapted with Jim Stark, one of the film's producers) and absurd twists to a scene (Dillon's laid-back narration sparks many of the underscored moments of hilarity at hand â€“ ie explaining Jan's shoddy car's lack of functioning headlights only to work when the equally malfunctioning springs to the car in affect bounce them on!)
VIDEOGAMES_287_11	negative	Cons: -Despite the fact the game comes on DVDs you still can't avoid disk swapping at certain parts if you install all the expansions.
VIDEOGAMES_292_5	positive	SSX 3 gives you a huge amount of freedom, because you can explore the mountain all by yourself and there are no linear routes that you have to take.
VIDEOGAMES_273_0	positive	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....
BOOKS_152_1	neutral	I find her life to be fascinating yet so many details were missing.
VIDEOGAMES_134_2	negative	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
BOOKS_149_7	negative	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
VIDEOGAMES_120_5	negative	can't beat 'em so buy out the rights to make it at all???
VIDEOGAMES_274_0	negative	Pros: It makes a great coaster for a frothy beverage!!!
ELECTRONICS_218_8	negative	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
VIDEOGAMES_126_18	negative	Not only is this game an embarrassment and rip-off, it was created for the sole purpose of making a quick buck off Naruto fans.
VIDEOGAMES_126_7	negative	This is a bad idea because matches involve no strategy at all.
BOOKS_172_1	positive	This book should be right on your shelf next to Strunk and White, another writing manual that King references often in the pages of On Writing.
ELECTRONICS_76_7	positive	Customer service though is very good and very responsive.
BOOKS_150_1	negative	The anthropological reputation of Chagnon remains intact, unlike those of anthropologists who have endorsed this dishonest, tabloid-calibre book.
MUSIC_114_6	positive	And Brian Leary's voice is the perfect accompaniment to it all, pulling it all together like Rain Parade did in their best moments.
MUSIC_89_0	negative	This cd was horrible.
VIDEOGAMES_134_46	negative	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
MUSIC_260_15	positive	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
MUSIC_248_8	neutral	Both the Mix 2006 and this release have been slightly uninspired and it seems the Fierce Angels crew are giving them a run for their money, both in quality of the packaging and music.
DVDS_181_0	negative	Ruining a classic should be against the law.
DVDS_182_0	negative	After the heated opening and things settle down from all the hoop-la even sane Star Wars addicts will admit that the acting & dialog were painful to endure.
VIDEOGAMES_275_1	neutral	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
BOOKS_162_6	negative	The trouble is that ""Book 1: Production"", is missing completely.
VIDEOGAMES_127_19	neutral	I'm a musical guy, so I tend to pay close attention to BGM. Whoever wrote wrote the music for this game was successful, and nicely recreated old favorites like the O2 song from Kirby 64. But there are other songs that don't fit to well with the whole ""Brawling"" thing.
MUSIC_106_5	positive	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
VIDEOGAMES_124_25	neutral	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
MUSIC_253_10	neutral	Don't get wrong if I lost for broke this cd I will buy it again, It was a good project I just wish different things could have been done.
MUSIC_249_10	neutral	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.
VIDEOGAMES_284_2	negative	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
BOOKS_168_25	positive	Good work.
VIDEOGAMES_137_29	positive	Score: 5.5/10 Graphics- Not bad, in fact, I'd say they're pretty good.
VIDEOGAMES_266_5	negative	What I didn't like about this game was that the last level was just like the first.
DVDS_198_1	positive	BAM! combo of indie filmmaker Christopher Nolan and Bale (with an intense, brooding yet vulnerable turn and a fine jaw for the infamous cowl to boot!)
VIDEOGAMES_140_12	positive	The way troops react is so realistic it is unparalleled.
DVDS_192_21	negative	What really makes me hard pressed to call this a great movie though is the uninspired dialogue that spans across each character.
MUSIC_90_5	negative	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
VIDEOGAMES_271_4	negative	You cannot access menus through use of the mouse, which is so counter intuitive that it screams fail.
MUSIC_89_4	negative	I threw away the cd after listening to 2 songs.
BOOKS_146_7	negative	As I read the other reviews on this site, I could not believe that the shallow characters and relationships in the book actually satisfied people's literary tastes and excited their emotions.
VIDEOGAMES_269_1	negative	The second installment in the Final Fantasy Legends series, is probably the worst, and later on, becomes physically painful to play.
MUSIC_112_17	neutral	'All We Know Is Falling' is a sing and dance along album that will get stuck in your head.
MUSIC_107_12	positive	9. Table For two - 5/5stars Nice feel to the music.
MUSIC_111_4	positive	Super quiet soft passages and reasonably rocking loud ones without a hint of tape hiss, it's all here.
ELECTRONICS_77_4	negative	...Cons: Gets very hot.
BOOKS_162_3	positive	Mill's ""Principles"" are required reading for everyone seriously interested in the history of economic thought.
ELECTRONICS_225_0	neutral	Pros: Durable, Quiet ... Cons: Slow Connection I picked this up as a backup device for home machines as well as a home office computer.
VIDEOGAMES_280_9	positive	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
BOOKS_145_1	negative	The selling point (I thought) in the REA book was the ""Six full length practice exams"" it advertises.
ELECTRONICS_230_10	positive	Overall, very impressive speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_136_34	neutral	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
VIDEOGAMES_274_5	negative	simply, THIS WAS RELEASED, NOT TO REJUVINATE THE COMMUNITY, BUT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK. If ya wanna fly around and blow stuff up like a mongoloid retard, BUY THIS SIM!
VIDEOGAMES_128_7	negative	For the music part the music is pretty weird too.
VIDEOGAMES_136_8	positive	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
DVDS_191_17	negative	And that's what this film is about, nodding to the first film since it now seems a life-time away that these brothers can do something even resembling interesting.
ELECTRONICS_221_1	neutral	However, I would like to share my thoughts, It's a very powerful laptop, 2.8GHz,4GB RAM, 320 HD, 13"" There is no problem whatsoever on the spec's BUT the fan always go on when I use the express gate, with no reason!
BOOKS_151_4	negative	There's even a chapter about developing a ""magnetic eye!""
VIDEOGAMES_291_2	neutral	a good game, but not what i expected...
MUSIC_260_14	positive	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
BOOKS_170_15	positive	The marine Brigadier General is the US militaries most honor soldier, having recieved 2 Medals of Honor and 1 Brevet Medal (No longer issued, akin to the Medal of Honor).
ELECTRONICS_225_6	negative	Now - i used the included software to run a backup of a roughly 300 gig drive that is relatively full and it took almost 2 days for the 1st image to complete...
MUSIC_235_5	negative	I think the dj tried so hard to be in the scene and he impresses no one at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_10	positive	Also, the explosions look great.
VIDEOGAMES_137_39	negative	If they are going to give us the same music that you keep hearing, day after day, hour after hour, why didn't they take their time and compose some good music, like the Summer and Fall ones?
VIDEOGAMES_287_16	neutral	This can't really be helped though, since it would have been difficult to drive the story on if all the major characters were absent since you killed them during Baldur's Gate 1! But these aren't REALLY cons, just some of the things I spotted and said 'That could have been slightly better'.
ELECTRONICS_215_7	negative	2)this could be a deal-breaker: In the middle of a conversation, even with the cellphone within a few feet of the headset, this Bluetooth sometimes disconnects itself, and the call has reverted back to the cellphone.
DVDS_176_4	positive	The idea of a 'comic book' movie is implemented well I must say.
ELECTRONICS_216_3	neutral	In a situations where it should widen the apperture, it never does.
MUSIC_244_9	negative	There was no emotion, they all sounded exactly the same: bland, dull, and over-polished.
BOOKS_156_12	neutral	And sure there's a lot of biblical allusions, questioning of goals and life, and Hemingway's prostilization of his whole ""philosophy of man"" dogma.
VIDEOGAMES_266_10	neutral	So to sum it up: OK: The graphics (on a scale of 1 to ten; 4) The music (it was ok, but not awe in spiring) BAD: The weapons (there were only four different kinds, and one type of shield) The bosses (Egyptian and Greek Gods DON'T mix!)
ELECTRONICS_216_18	positive	1. The colors are natural and accurate.
ELECTRONICS_206_4	negative	3. The much publicised flashing lights in the top for six smart ""internal"" antennas are if you are not going to place the router in a secluded area likely to become an irritant - walking into my darkened study it was at times like seeing a cheap sci-fi effect.
MUSIC_264_13	positive	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
BOOKS_169_13	neutral	Maybe a chapter on how men could treat women with respect during a sales meeting (trust me, I witnessed the degradation of women in many a sales meeting) or some way women can deal with the constant sexual marketing happening today.
VIDEOGAMES_141_13	negative	Cons: Guns are weak and inaccurate.
ELECTRONICS_218_3	positive	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
VIDEOGAMES_279_10	negative	I gave this game a 6 for the gameplay because of the lack of features they included in this version of the game versus the Xbox 1 version.
VIDEOGAMES_134_68	negative	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
ELECTRONICS_76_5	negative	You are unable to check a log or bread crumb pattern.
ELECTRONICS_216_21	positive	4. The battery life is impressive.
VIDEOGAMES_288_4	neutral	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
VIDEOGAMES_134_3	neutral	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
VIDEOGAMES_140_22	positive	The graphics are sweet.
VIDEOGAMES_281_2	negative	utterly disappointing.
BOOKS_168_13	negative	* The book could stand another 100 pages or so.
DVDS_178_0	negative	The idea to use the Tooth Fairy as a slasher sounded like a good idea at first.
BOOKS_145_5	negative	The biggest failing is the lack of depth about the AP test or proper strategy.
BOOKS_174_11	positive	But the biblical, practical advice in The Language of Love and Respect helps us speak one another's language, and grow a God-honoring marriage.
VIDEOGAMES_284_6	negative	The 40 bucks I spent for this game is sorley missed, refund is desired k thanks.
MUSIC_243_4	positive	The jazz into on the instrumental song is the best part of this whole album.
ELECTRONICS_232_7	neutral	Still it is running windows, not that 7 isn'ta great improvement.
VIDEOGAMES_124_24	negative	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
ELECTRONICS_216_4	neutral	It tends to favor longer exposure times.
ELECTRONICS_225_10	neutral	will continue to search for other backup software
ELECTRONICS_74_7	negative	The one thing I really don't like about the Terk FDTV2A is that none of the cables and cords can be easily replaced.
VIDEOGAMES_118_3	negative	There is hardly any new competitive multiplayer content.
VIDEOGAMES_143_4	positive	As with all star wars games the sound is great but, the voice acting especially shines.
DVDS_205_9	positive	Harry is next whisked to sunny LA by Shaw for meet-and-greets to create serious buzz and enlists the unexpected thief a lesson to be a detective with Shaw's for hire gumshoe ""Gay"" Perry (Kilmer equally having a ball and a natural flair for tongue-in-cheek humor), a tougher than he appears homosexual who is reluctant to have the flaky Harry tag-along to get notes for his 'character'.
MUSIC_111_1	positive	Alice digs it too, and this DVD-Audio release is a real treat.
VIDEOGAMES_136_20	positive	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_269_10	negative	And when you get to the later levels, and the monsters are extremely tough, this becomes even more annoying, with the limited weapons use.
MUSIC_110_7	positive	If you only buy one Raymond Scott CD, this MUST be the one to get.
VIDEOGAMES_269_14	negative	Luckily, you do run into a few ''super'' weapons that don't have any ''hit points'' but they're very few, and by the time you find them, you've probably already grown sick of this game, and thrown it against a wall.
VIDEOGAMES_138_6	positive	If you can live with that, you WILL enjoy this game!
VIDEOGAMES_290_9	positive	I also haven't encountered any drops in the game's frame rate.
VIDEOGAMES_285_12	positive	The voices are done well!
MUSIC_97_2	positive	Great cut: Bombay Calling - a wonderful violin driven instrumental that makes you bounce in your seat.
ELECTRONICS_216_22	positive	I would take in excess of 100 (more even) shots without a recharge fully using the lcd screen.
ELECTRONICS_73_3	negative	Each disk starts out playing fine, then starts to stop and start repeatedly, and finally just stops playing.
BOOKS_158_9	neutral	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
MUSIC_261_5	positive	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
DVDS_194_1	neutral	I thought that Cris Evans did a pretty good job of the human torch (Johnny Storm).
MUSIC_240_0	negative	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
VIDEOGAMES_118_2	negative	The missions are dark and pretty dull.
VIDEOGAMES_271_1	negative	And I thought Mass Effect was bad.
MUSIC_108_2	positive	After listening to them, i knew i had to get the actual album!
VIDEOGAMES_140_2	positive	It is the most original RTS game out there, as it adds in a role playing flavor with the advent of Heroes, special characters each of the races have.
VIDEOGAMES_290_8	positive	The mouth physics on the dog work perfectly, the dog's body animations feel perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_137_62	positive	Compared to some other games I played, it can rocks.
VIDEOGAMES_290_16	positive	9/10. Great Job!
ELECTRONICS_226_1	positive	The 4gb of RAM makes it fly when using any program and the hard drive is huge.
ELECTRONICS_221_6	neutral	other than that, it was good!
BOOKS_163_5	positive	I wonder how he thought of all that rhymes.
MUSIC_240_1	negative	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
DVDS_179_4	negative	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
MUSIC_109_1	positive	You get ALL of the material from the 2 CD special edition release, but it is in the higher fidelity of SACD and is all on one disc.
VIDEOGAMES_143_10	negative	And the frame chugs every so often.
MUSIC_95_11	negative	Um, and that one guy that wrote the review that says, ""these guys are mega wicked chill"" um, I think you must wear like Calvin Klien or Armani, because your pockets are so tight, and I don't even think you know what you're talking about.
BOOKS_172_11	positive	Like, love or loathe his fiction, you'll find a wealth of solid advice in this little book.
DVDS_178_17	neutral	It probably would have been considered groundbreaking for a television horror movie.
BOOKS_170_26	negative	The graphic images from ""The Horror of It"" seem tame by today's standards.
VIDEOGAMES_267_0	negative	""All flash, no substance"" Features -All skill-requiring mini-games have been removed!
VIDEOGAMES_291_29	positive	Score 8.9
VIDEOGAMES_122_5	negative	Exactly what soldier did they consult for those great hints?
MUSIC_103_8	negative	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
MUSIC_86_13	negative	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
MUSIC_100_0	negative	...but ""A Night at the Opera"" just doesn't do it for me.
VIDEOGAMES_137_30	positive	Especially the shopkeepers, they're very well designed when you see them in the shops.
MUSIC_107_5	positive	The chorus is just so nice to listen to.
ELECTRONICS_81_5	positive	Glad I didn't take it back.
MUSIC_242_10	neutral	The title track is passable.
VIDEOGAMES_130_7	neutral	Great game to rent, but most definitely not a keeper
VIDEOGAMES_127_26	negative	What a waste of time.
ELECTRONICS_232_3	positive	Its 50 percent more powerful than a similar turon or core 2 duo of the same specs., and it outperforms both the Macbook air 13inch, $1700,, and Macbook pro $1499, in fact the I5 simply allows for more end use ram, and virtual processors, a feature yet to be taken advantage of for most users, but one necessary for future proofing, and currently, for high end, graphic intensive software.
MUSIC_98_7	negative	It's like listening to Santana perform and having the bassist playing about 20 feet behind them with his amp turned down really low.
VIDEOGAMES_125_10	negative	The crowd sound effect is almost, if not worse then the music (Apes chanting???).
BOOKS_150_2	negative	The book's egregious distortions and errors were first discovered in the manuscript, and I was expecting them to be corrected in the final version, but nope, they all appear to be there.
BOOKS_168_14	negative	I felt some chapters could have been expanded to include more information.
MUSIC_112_3	positive	Led by 17 year old vocalist Hayley Williams, the band also features guitarist Josh Farro, drummer Zac Farro, bassist Jeremy Davis, and rhythm guitarist Hunter Lamb, all under the age of 21. The album starts with ""All We Know"", a catchy (but straightforward, systemaic) power-pop song.
ELECTRONICS_224_10	negative	It's pretty frustrating.
VIDEOGAMES_277_4	negative	I have a lot of problems with this game.
MUSIC_88_4	negative	The quality of this DVD is horrible and look like it was transfer from an Old VHS source.
ELECTRONICS_78_1	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
DVDS_196_5	positive	My favorite lines: James as Leon to Ford's Deckard in a compromising position: 'Wake up.
MUSIC_94_14	negative	the other songs may very well be excellent but i couldn't bring myself to keeping it after hearing the cure tune)
VIDEOGAMES_122_0	negative	I'm going to voice my biggest complaint about this game first, so that anyone thinking of buying BIA because it looks ""realistic"" or because it looks like a ""simulation"" might be deterred.
MUSIC_89_2	negative	they changed all there great songs into bad ballads.
VIDEOGAMES_136_24	positive	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
VIDEOGAMES_133_7	neutral	Music 4/5 pretty good music i would say Graphics 3/5 really update, say the big word with me UP-DATE. this should look cleaner but it doesn't Story 1/5 New story please and varied bosses not just the same 4 with varying difficulty Total 5/10 Not the worst game I have played but not the best.
VIDEOGAMES_122_4	negative	The tutorial part of the game actually instructs you to use things like fences as defendable positions.
MUSIC_101_6	neutral	This DVD was interesting but was a far cry from the complete picture.
MUSIC_97_5	neutral	Great to hear it, but it makes its point and then pounds you to death with it OK Cut: Girl with No Eyes (what is this song trying to tell us?)
VIDEOGAMES_132_3	neutral	It generally follows the same feel of the N64 version, but it adds something different.
VIDEOGAMES_115_0	neutral	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_213_2	positive	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
BOOKS_145_2	negative	Though these tests are long, the questions are simplistic and are little like real AP questions.
VIDEOGAMES_140_21	positive	Any race can truly beat any race.
VIDEOGAMES_115_2	negative	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
DVDS_187_2	negative	I personally would like to blame it on the editing, at the beginning in particular I found myself unable to blink without missing a scene.
ELECTRONICS_216_6	negative	And, thus, I wound up with blurry or dark pictures.
ELECTRONICS_223_12	neutral	After the installation, it has worked like a charm, but you just have to pray that you never ever have to contact Logitech for their ""support"".
VIDEOGAMES_287_4	positive	-100+ hours of pure RPG bliss, with an epic storyline to match.
MUSIC_258_4	positive	Every family should own a copy of this great CD!
MUSIC_99_7	negative	Because I don't care for country, and because I really do like the quirk in Wilco and Bragg, this album doesn't do much for me.
ELECTRONICS_232_13	neutral	That usually makes my eyes tired, but I guess the led is different because as of yet there have been no problems.
DVDS_181_4	negative	Fox...you dropped the ball I'm sad to say.
VIDEOGAMES_127_29	negative	So sad......
DVDS_199_4	positive	His latest is no exception.
VIDEOGAMES_279_11	negative	I mean no superstar moves, no dunk contest, where's franchise mode???
BOOKS_152_6	neutral	While I appreciate her efforts and the insights into this kind of life, I was unsatsified with her tale.
VIDEOGAMES_287_7	positive	Then dump her in the inn (or kill her if you are feeling particularly evil) and go off gallivanting with the Halfing pirate and insane necromancer instead!
VIDEOGAMES_124_16	negative	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
VIDEOGAMES_134_42	negative	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
VIDEOGAMES_285_8	neutral	Challenge: 6/10 I found some of the puzzles pretty confusing...and challenging....The bosses you just treat in the normal First Person manor...The enemies are pretty simple...Just go out there, move around, and if you are good enough, you can dodge lots of bullets and shoot the bloody hell outta them.....
DVDS_179_2	negative	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
BOOKS_150_9	positive	On the positive side, Tierney's got a smooth narrative style, and the book might make a nice novel.
BOOKS_172_9	positive	He speaks candidly about his youth, his addictions, and his career, giving much credit to wife Tabitha for her contributions to both his writing and his sanity.
BOOKS_162_1	positive	But it's remarkable how well Mill's thoughts about the mechanics of the economy, and how they affect the fabric of society, have aged.
DVDS_193_2	positive	Well get this chemical makeup: Stunning and popular star Lara Flynn Boyle overtly titillating us and wearing skimpy outfits even including a bikini(!), Timothy Hutton, habitual scene stealer Oliver Platt during younger and thinner days, superstar Faye Dunaway, and Steven Webber from the TV show ""Wings."" How's that for voltage?
ELECTRONICS_218_11	negative	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
MUSIC_239_2	neutral	Don't get me wrong, there are a couple dope songs to bump in your ride but its not worth purchasing the whole cd for them.
ELECTRONICS_216_13	negative	I can't use a camera that not only doesn't let me control something as simple as the apperture, but it makes bad choices about the lighting.
BOOKS_168_11	positive	Most authors examine all angles of interpretation through the ages and give a decent bibliography at the end of each chapter.
VIDEOGAMES_279_18	negative	It's like NBA Live without serveral of the features that make Live such a fun bball series.
VIDEOGAMES_119_0	negative	This is the worst game I have ever played.
MUSIC_103_1	negative	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
ELECTRONICS_81_0	positive	Pros: The instructions were very helpful and easy to use.
MUSIC_90_6	negative	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.
VIDEOGAMES_277_26	negative	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.
ELECTRONICS_231_4	positive	This even drew compliments from my brother who has a panasonic plasma.
VIDEOGAMES_137_36	positive	Not perfect graphics, but extremely good graphics!
VIDEOGAMES_120_7	negative	EA Sports aren't Gods of anything...
VIDEOGAMES_134_79	negative	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
DVDS_192_14	neutral	While the action segments do feature cool effects, the camera's rapid and erratic nature makes it hard for you to appreciate them.
MUSIC_259_8	positive	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
MUSIC_264_14	positive	Incomparable is really the best word to describe ""Le Fil.""
MUSIC_238_12	negative	But believe me, this is still not a reccomendation.
ELECTRONICS_207_12	neutral	I am so sorry because is a very nice and extremely practical bag otherwise.
DVDS_205_6	neutral	If you want subtle watch an Ivory Merchant production.
VIDEOGAMES_273_4	negative	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
VIDEOGAMES_277_8	negative	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
MUSIC_100_5	neutral	The songs ""Precious Jerusalem,"" ""Sadly Sings Destiny,"" and ""The Soulforged"" are all highly listenable, and I would say, if you are a Blind Guardian fan, you should buy this CD. Just don't expect the brilliance of earlier releases.
BOOKS_165_7	positive	Notes he had written included, ""You do this now but I suggest . . . I think we do this but the employees need a refresher course . . . Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.
DVDS_178_24	negative	But I hate it since I had to pay 8 bucks for something that should have been a SCI-FI, USA or an ABC movie of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_275_10	negative	and if die is game over...
VIDEOGAMES_141_4	positive	Big selection of military vehicles.
BOOKS_148_2	negative	The first being that her ego pervades the whole book, dominates and deludes the message.
ELECTRONICS_73_6	negative	I guess not!""
MUSIC_261_1	positive	Well ""Hyperborea"" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
MUSIC_95_7	negative	And the drummer, he is so good, he keeps it in, out, and in the middle of the pocket, and his pork chops, they are so salty, if you licked it you would have to wince.
VIDEOGAMES_141_2	positive	Pros: Fun game play.
MUSIC_103_5	negative	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply ""starts"".
MUSIC_244_5	negative	I'm one of the idiots who purchased the deluxe album, and after unwrapping it at home and actually checking out the track listing and such, all of these songs could have DEFINATELY fit onto one album.
VIDEOGAMES_132_18	negative	The game seems as if it merely copied of Mario Kart DS at parts.
ELECTRONICS_215_4	positive	Also it sits nicely on a countertop, making the set less easy to lose.
VIDEOGAMES_280_2	positive	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
DVDS_187_17	negative	they are sharing the most passionate love story you can ever imagine.
VIDEOGAMES_137_40	positive	Those are good, and they won't bother you before a long time.
ELECTRONICS_216_31	neutral	Sorry Canon. Maybe the next Elph will be better and I'll buy that one.
VIDEOGAMES_125_7	negative	Unfortunately the game lacks substance.
VIDEOGAMES_138_3	positive	There is no doubt that great fun can be had in this game, so you can take what the critics say with a pinch of salt...
DVDS_179_0	negative	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
ELECTRONICS_78_10	positive	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
VIDEOGAMES_275_11	negative	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
VIDEOGAMES_282_8	positive	Simple, but addicting.
VIDEOGAMES_116_5	negative	Then getting into the game itself this type of tediousness continues all over again.
VIDEOGAMES_124_22	negative	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
MUSIC_92_4	negative	and cheesy lyrics from Sammy. No wonder Cherone is in the band now.
DVDS_178_10	negative	The little kid, who this Tooth-Fairy is after at the beginning, is just as boring as the little kid whom he tries to help after becoming an adult.
BOOKS_161_1	neutral	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
ELECTRONICS_222_2	neutral	After a power outage it does restart with the correct time - if the time was right when the power went out.
ELECTRONICS_214_8	negative	If I were to buy more of these like I had planned, My desktop would be cluttered with a bunch of meaningless virtual CDs. This intrusion may not annoy Windows users as the Virtual CDs will just clutter up your ""My Computer"" window; but, on a Mac this type of unalterable intrusion is beyond unacceptable.
VIDEOGAMES_269_3	negative	Story : 1/10 Here's where things start to go bad.
ELECTRONICS_72_11	negative	Then I tried Best Buy, where I had bought the camera, but they also had no such adapter and no such accessory kit.
MUSIC_236_10	neutral	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
DVDS_192_17	negative	But these aren't the worst complaints I have with AV. Plot wise, AV struggles to develop anything that could resemble an engaging masterpiece.
MUSIC_103_12	positive	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
VIDEOGAMES_124_13	negative	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
BOOKS_160_5	neutral	I only gave three starts because it is not so likely that I will read this book again in the near future.
MUSIC_103_4	negative	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_291_3	positive	Story The plot is what really kept me fromlosing hope of this game.
MUSIC_252_8	neutral	Sounds like Mr. Clapton was in his Safe Eric mode, offering exact reproductions without fire, combustion or chemistry.
MUSIC_94_2	negative	then he goes out and does something stupid like record this song...
ELECTRONICS_82_4	positive	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.
VIDEOGAMES_141_11	positive	Airstrikes are great, fun, and you'll always have them.
VIDEOGAMES_286_0	positive	""Revolutionary"" Halo was one of those games you cannot live without.
VIDEOGAMES_292_11	positive	There is so much too do.
MUSIC_97_0	positive	Great cut: Hot Summer Day: unique, superb mix of instruments (violin, harmonica, keyboard, and electric guitar), nice vocals (the lyrics are kinda dumb, but that's part of the 60s), fantastic build up...everything that characterizes a great 60s song.
VIDEOGAMES_134_64	negative	This makes the game way too easy.
VIDEOGAMES_131_4	negative	Some of the chapters are extremely difficult where you have to kill hundreds of aliens before you get to save the game at a checkpoint.
VIDEOGAMES_144_2	positive	Fun and distinctive classes.
DVDS_181_14	negative	It is very much like the way the 51' movie portrayed them.
BOOKS_169_14	positive	Overall, it was a good book.
MUSIC_254_14	negative	But I must confess that the new album falls fairly flat for me.
VIDEOGAMES_136_26	positive	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
MUSIC_91_4	negative	Looking over the lyric sheet it appears he's written the same song over and over again for three albums.
DVDS_187_20	positive	but the moive has it's high points, the CGI is great and the Dragon fights were amazing.
ELECTRONICS_216_27	negative	Unfortunately, it takes terrible pictures because of something that would have been so easy for Canon to fix.
VIDEOGAMES_138_4	neutral	However, I must agree that you have to get used to the AI - it's kind of irritating to kill some of your enemies; they practically run around trying to dodge you.
VIDEOGAMES_132_2	neutral	The story is nothing to die for, but is alright.
MUSIC_240_4	negative	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
VIDEOGAMES_288_5	positive	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
ELECTRONICS_224_11	positive	The printer itself works great.
VIDEOGAMES_117_9	negative	The controls are sloppy and it is hard to be very accurate.
DVDS_195_4	negative	On top of that, the film has an amateurish quality (a not-very-similar-looking actor plays Rock speaking from the world beyond, sometimes with his image inserted into the frame with the real Rock Hudson).
VIDEOGAMES_126_14	neutral	The music in this game isn't that bad, but most of it is forgettable, it'll also get repetitive at some point due to redoing a mission many times or trying to beat all 60+ missions.
VIDEOGAMES_135_0	positive	""Amazing"" I have an N64 as you already know, and at first the only good game i had was Super Mario 64 and LOZ:OOT. I knew there had to be more games than that.
VIDEOGAMES_135_5	positive	Graphics- For N64 is was really good!
ELECTRONICS_227_15	positive	Well, simply learning how to adjust a few menu options in the FZ30 and learning when and how to use the appropriate accessories will get you almost the same results with the FZ30 a $500.00 camera as with a $5000. camera.
VIDEOGAMES_272_18	negative	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.
DVDS_178_26	negative	A good idea done completely wrong and not worth the cash I had to pay to see it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_12	positive	Love RPG's get it.
DVDS_193_10	negative	I agree with others that the ending seems as tho it was written on the spot when someone lost the rest of the script.
VIDEOGAMES_289_15	negative	If you get bad position, just START OVER. In fact, let me file that one complaint: starting location in the galaxy (which seems fairly randomized) should not be such a profound determinant to the outcome.
VIDEOGAMES_137_28	negative	This is about it for the gameplay part, but I won't give it a high score, it's not really good.
VIDEOGAMES_139_3	positive	the war torn cities are immensely detailed, the effects are pretty damn good aswell.
ELECTRONICS_226_7	positive	The battery also lasts 4 hours on power saver mode!
BOOKS_169_4	positive	Pace gives us many tips and access to research to help us deal cross-gender.
MUSIC_256_8	positive	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
ELECTRONICS_218_5	negative	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to ""reboot"" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
BOOKS_173_6	positive	If the tour visits your city, don't miss it.
VIDEOGAMES_126_8	negative	To make things worse, Tomy added alot of playable characters from the anime in this game, it's too bad all of them play EXACTLY the same.
ELECTRONICS_73_1	negative	The Bottom Line: If you are interested in purchasing a DVD/VCR combo player, I would recommend a different brand due to Sony's exchange policy and horrible service.
VIDEOGAMES_136_36	positive	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
MUSIC_112_14	neutral	These few songs show the age of the band the most, but I'm sure as they grow their lyrics will grow with them.
DVDS_187_21	positive	The entire Mage counsel building is majestic, and the cotumes and make up are great as well.
VIDEOGAMES_269_21	negative	EVEN IF YOU SEE IT FOR ONLY 2 DOLLARS!
DVDS_200_8	neutral	While not a classic like ""The Player"" or even ""Network"" the film works on its own merits by not caving in to be likable either; Lenny wouldn't have it any other way.
ELECTRONICS_234_5	positive	Nice touch.
ELECTRONICS_232_6	positive	Both have great displays.
VIDEOGAMES_127_34	negative	If your not, then you won't.
VIDEOGAMES_131_0	positive	Halo has a creative plot, some interesting sets, cool weapons and aliens.
VIDEOGAMES_137_17	negative	All you see is the counter with the produces on display and the shopkeeper in front of you.
VIDEOGAMES_286_5	negative	I think in multiplayer you should be able to fly a pelican to drop of ammo and vehicles to your allies but if the other team shoots it down, it will not spawn until the next match.
DVDS_195_8	negative	All stones were left unturned.
MUSIC_264_1	positive	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
MUSIC_236_8	negative	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
ELECTRONICS_207_4	negative	Now the bad part: The closures (plastic snappers) are of very cheap plastic.
MUSIC_240_8	negative	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
MUSIC_241_5	neutral	I liked the idea made by a previous reviewer when he stated that remastering these CD's in both STEREO and MONO, just as Capitol did with The Beatles box set of the first four Beatles' Capitol albums, would have been nice.
VIDEOGAMES_282_0	neutral	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
VIDEOGAMES_137_58	negative	it's not a good game.
BOOKS_163_3	positive	It also very exciting to kids 3-6 years old.
ELECTRONICS_73_2	negative	I previously posted the following review of this player: ""My Sony D500P arrived yesterday, and I tried two different DVDs, but both played poorly.
VIDEOGAMES_275_3	negative	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
ELECTRONICS_214_12	negative	Until Western Digital rethinks their strategy and changes this practice, their hard drives should be avoided and boycotted.
BOOKS_161_3	positive	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
VIDEOGAMES_115_3	negative	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
MUSIC_90_3	negative	This album more or less sucks.
ELECTRONICS_207_11	negative	As it is, I consider this bag as no good even for the beginning amateur.
BOOKS_162_8	neutral	That's the reason I'm giving the book three stars: five for the content, one for the edition.
DVDS_177_6	negative	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
VIDEOGAMES_292_13	positive	GET SSX 3! That's my only conclusion, if you don't have this game in your collection, get it now while it's still there and go and shame yourself!!!
DVDS_178_2	positive	There are only two scenes that I enjoyed in this entire film.
VIDEOGAMES_293_4	positive	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).
ELECTRONICS_216_26	positive	It's amazing.
DVDS_204_8	positive	One day Keane sees a single mother and child (Ryan and Breslin, both excellent) arguing with the desk clerk over money and he ingratiates himself by offering her a hundred dollars to get her by (earlier he is shown in a near similar sequence) and Lynn and Kira invite him over the next night for a takeout dinner.
BOOKS_161_9	negative	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.
ELECTRONICS_216_14	negative	Even in bright daylight, in the shadow of a pine tree, the jitter light was on because it was choosing horrible exposure times!
MUSIC_257_1	positive	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
VIDEOGAMES_143_7	positive	Plus full customization of your character.
VIDEOGAMES_134_60	negative	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
ELECTRONICS_218_0	positive	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
ELECTRONICS_76_3	negative	The issue is the online interface.
DVDS_186_4	negative	DVD should have been much better as well.
MUSIC_102_1	positive	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
VIDEOGAMES_129_4	negative	Rinse, repeat, add water if necessary.
VIDEOGAMES_140_11	positive	The ability to put spells on auto-cast (and the effectiveness of the AI at deploying them) is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_120_0	negative	The only reason I give it a 1 is because of the graphics, just as another review stated: terrible game with nice coat of paint to hide it's rust.
VIDEOGAMES_137_19	negative	At your farm, the only place (beside festivals) you can move around, all you do is care about your farm.
BOOKS_170_6	positive	The soldier is a Marine which ads credibility from a leadership tradition know for its 'fighting spirit'.
DVDS_192_7	positive	The beautiful church with the flower pile will give you some nostalgia if you're a fan of the series, as with the infamous although brief ""bathing of Aeris"" scene (Aerith if you live in Japan).
ELECTRONICS_73_25	neutral	The instruction manual is a little confusing, but helpful in explaining how to use the remote.
VIDEOGAMES_139_4	negative	some units arnet up to scratch however.
VIDEOGAMES_117_5	neutral	The graphics are not on par with the great shooters, but they are still pretty good.
DVDS_182_1	positive	Too bad, 'cause the visual fireworks were great.
MUSIC_236_6	negative	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
ELECTRONICS_82_1	positive	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
VIDEOGAMES_127_6	positive	I played the next day and had fun.
VIDEOGAMES_124_20	negative	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
MUSIC_235_4	negative	It runs on and on again ...It is really boring music.
MUSIC_103_14	neutral	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
MUSIC_242_9	negative	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
VIDEOGAMES_267_4	negative	But it's cool if you don't have one because then you have a space on every board that does nothing!
BOOKS_146_2	negative	I was outraged at the reviews and acclaim it has recieved, so much so that I decided to write my first review.
DVDS_192_5	positive	First off the CG (as I expected) is gorgeous to say the least.
ELECTRONICS_206_2	negative	1. Dreadful to set up - the claim about wizard guide was of limited use after setting up the base unit, and I had to get a good friend to spend several hours doing for me.
VIDEOGAMES_275_2	neutral	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
DVDS_192_25	neutral	While it may be appealing to niche crowds such as hardcore fans (minus me), anime junkies, and artists alike, it fails to encompass many key elements that make a solid flick.
DVDS_194_9	positive	9/10. Ps Go see this great movie!
VIDEOGAMES_139_5	neutral	Sound Explosions and bullets sound great, but the voice acting and those corney videos, o dear....
MUSIC_109_10	positive	Shel Talmy did a superb remastering job...he really cares about these recordings regardless of his professional problems with the Who. YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THIS ONE!!
VIDEOGAMES_272_12	negative	They just come rushing towards you.
VIDEOGAMES_276_13	negative	Another issue is the loss of the original design illustrations.
ELECTRONICS_230_8	positive	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
DVDS_195_0	neutral	This film covers in a limited sense what THE CELLULOID CLOSET covers more professionally and comprehensively.
BOOKS_170_17	neutral	The answer to this claim is for the reader to determine, but seems apart from the ideas presented by the author.
VIDEOGAMES_290_7	positive	8.5/10 Graphics: The graphics almost look lifelike.
DVDS_197_0	positive	THE LOST CITY (2006) *** Andy Garcia, Ines Sastre, Tomas Milian, Enrique Murciano, Bill Murray, Dustin Hoffman, Millie Perkins, Nestor Carbonell, Steven Bauer, Richard Bradford, Dominik Garcia-Lorido, Julio Oscar Mechosa, Juan Fernandez, Elizabeth Pena, William Marquez, Tony Plana, (Dir: Garcia) Andy Garcia's Bittersweet Valentine To Cuba Andy Garcia has always been a favorite of mine to watch on screen, with his fiery, impassionate no-holds-barred, cool-as-a-cucumber performances with both excessive and implosive turns and his passion is now on full display in his directorial debut, a valentine to his beloved homeland Cuba. Garcia stars as Fico Fellove, a nightclub owner and musician in Havana, circa 1958, on the cusp of the Cuban revolution and a drastic turn of historical events that will forever change his heart and soul.
VIDEOGAMES_130_1	positive	With very nice execution style moves with the knife i got into it very quick.
VIDEOGAMES_119_1	negative	The story makes Stargate Atlatis look like Oscar material.
VIDEOGAMES_117_12	negative	This wouldn't be so bad if I wasn't using the damn thing every 10 seconds.
VIDEOGAMES_125_4	neutral	Although I only have experience with choosing pit fighter I am not sure how much the different styles effect your customizable move list but you will definitely see a difference between submission VS wrestling.
MUSIC_238_14	negative	It's saddening to see talent put to waste, both from Beyonce, her song writers and producers who usually make such great music on their own.
MUSIC_238_0	negative	While I am a huge fan of Beyonce, when I bought this record, I listened to it...and the very same day sold is for 5 dollars at a discount used CD store.
VIDEOGAMES_123_3	negative	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a ""simple"" game.
VIDEOGAMES_117_11	negative	Like the injector that heals you, which means you have to put away your gun to heal yourself.
VIDEOGAMES_287_13	negative	-Similarly to games like Black and White who let you decide to either be naughty or nice, the good and evil aspect isn't exactly balanced.
VIDEOGAMES_134_25	negative	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
BOOKS_150_8	negative	And that's just the sources that CAN be fact-checked - who knows the extent to which he misrepresents his uncheckable sources on which his accusations depend (mission records, interviews, audio tapes, etc.). In fact, several of Tierney's interviewees have already come forward and said that Tierney does not quote them faithfully.
BOOKS_152_0	negative	I believe that Lily Burana had good intentions in writing this book but I as the reader sure didn't get it.
MUSIC_236_21	positive	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.
VIDEOGAMES_287_15	negative	-Since Baldur's Gate 2 isn't able to check what characters are dead and alive during your playthrough of the first game, if you play through both games you might find characters who you accidentally got beaten to death by a pack of gnolls being A-okay again (and the story of the second game also assumes you had a certain party-setup which you probably didn't).
ELECTRONICS_223_2	negative	Twice. I called the tech support (paying long distance charges), and after 20 minutes of waiting, got through.
VIDEOGAMES_119_6	negative	Of all my purchases, ( that include text-only games ) this is the one that I most regret.
DVDS_205_19	positive	Fast, fleet â€“footed and funny as hell the film runs on all cylinders damn the hard-to-follow loony plottings; who cares - check it out just for the hell of it!
DVDS_185_4	negative	Twists that just don't click.
DVDS_196_8	positive	during the climactic climb atop The Bradbury Building, as well as his improvised ""like tears in rain"" speech which always gets me.
MUSIC_264_11	positive	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
BOOKS_170_46	positive	I am upon writting this rewiew, impressed by how much such simple and short text has inspired me to think and how effective so few words can be at presenting such profound and compelling ideas for peace and prosperity.
ELECTRONICS_234_1	neutral	Works reasonably well in a noisy car.
VIDEOGAMES_141_12	positive	It's fun to get a sports car, or monster truck delivered to you in the middle of a battle.
VIDEOGAMES_288_2	positive	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
ELECTRONICS_74_8	negative	The coaxial cables are integrated directly into the both the antenna and amplifier; you can't just unscrew the cable from either and replace it with something else.
MUSIC_242_15	neutral	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
MUSIC_244_3	negative	Which is why I'm so appalled that she had the audacity to release such an album.
ELECTRONICS_208_4	negative	It syncs fine from your ipod/iphone to itunes but once it gets sent to [...] is when you get screwed.
MUSIC_259_5	positive	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
VIDEOGAMES_128_3	neutral	Other than that this game ain't that good.
VIDEOGAMES_124_12	negative	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
ELECTRONICS_215_2	positive	THAT feature is great!
ELECTRONICS_228_4	negative	Problems Encountered: Had one bad one that I had replaced.
ELECTRONICS_230_1	neutral	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
MUSIC_249_9	neutral	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
ELECTRONICS_227_16	positive	Yes, for the money and features this is the best of the bunch.
VIDEOGAMES_269_18	negative	Replay Value : 1/10 If you have enough strength to go through this game once, trust me, you'll never want to go through it again.
VIDEOGAMES_281_4	negative	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
BOOKS_151_2	neutral	If you enjoy the outrageous and the odd, as I do, you'll be delighted with this long-winded, pompous exposition of complete nonsense.
VIDEOGAMES_134_5	neutral	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
MUSIC_93_5	negative	Now, they changed for the sake of nothing.
DVDS_194_0	positive	This is one of the best superhero film ever beside spider man 2. I actually found this better than spider man because it was more realistic and didn't look as animated.
DVDS_197_8	neutral	It is obvious Garcia is focused on how things are to be depicted and it is remarkable in this seven year labor of love finally has emerged but there is a somewhat uneven tone throughout in deciding to be a ""Casablanca"" tinged melodrama or a ""Godfather"" wannabe with its sprawling plot lines and economy with words.
MUSIC_113_4	positive	What hummable songs and easy listening.
ELECTRONICS_81_6	positive	Have only used it a few times, but I am very pleased with it so far.
VIDEOGAMES_273_2	negative	He cried for about 45 mins after the end credits rolled.
DVDS_177_10	negative	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
DVDS_192_18	negative	To sum it up without revealing any details, there is no real character development.
VIDEOGAMES_144_6	negative	The Bad: As of May 2009, there are still critical bugs left in the game.
MUSIC_260_9	positive	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
MUSIC_236_2	negative	That said, this album is very poor.
VIDEOGAMES_277_19	negative	Brilliant, loving this.
VIDEOGAMES_134_78	negative	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
MUSIC_99_8	positive	If you can listen to an album because you know it's talent, or if you like country music, this album will please immensely.
VIDEOGAMES_134_38	negative	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
ELECTRONICS_231_1	neutral	Xbox 360 looks awesome but must have DCM off for any gaming or there is a crazy amount of response lag.
ELECTRONICS_216_12	negative	I'm sorry, but somebody with a pocket camera is NOT going to be carrying around a tripod to make sure their pics aren't blurry.
MUSIC_88_5	negative	Don't buy or rent this DVD
MUSIC_98_9	negative	In my own opinion, this release and Wings' VENUS & MARS are DTS' worst 5.1 CDs on the market.
DVDS_190_5	negative	Much of Rachel Wiess' scenes were shot from so far away it was hard to get into her character.
DVDS_176_6	negative	or will they ever ?? I really don't know what to say...
MUSIC_100_4	neutral	Also, I don't believe the songwriting on this is as creative as it has been on any of their four previous albums.
VIDEOGAMES_126_12	negative	You can also mix and match jutsu's from other characters, but that gets old fast.
VIDEOGAMES_275_13	negative	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
VIDEOGAMES_127_7	negative	For the first 20 minutes.
VIDEOGAMES_289_9	negative	That can be discouraging; when you seem to be getting off to a good start, only to have some aliens just stomp out your civilization with superior everything; and no help from your supposed allies.
DVDS_183_5	negative	I feel bad that there seems to be any comparison to the classic Jerry Lewis but some tread in that territory.
VIDEOGAMES_134_10	negative	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
VIDEOGAMES_127_3	positive	I get home and put the game in my Wii. The first few minutes I was thinking, ""Okay, this is pretty cool.""
BOOKS_151_0	negative	What a hoot!
BOOKS_165_8	positive	After reading The Profitable Retailer, and listening to his ideas, he might just be ready to tackle retail world.
MUSIC_254_18	neutral	But that's where ""Breathing Underwater"" deposits her.
ELECTRONICS_212_4	negative	Also NOTE: Software that comes with camera includes BACKWEB - if you are unfamiliar with backweb - it is SPYWARE.
MUSIC_108_3	positive	This ceedee is the one ceedee that is actually worth paying for.
VIDEOGAMES_121_0	negative	""Disastrous"" WOW, after months of waiting and anticipation I can only say that one word when playing one of the biggest dissapointments in gaming history.
VIDEOGAMES_288_10	positive	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
VIDEOGAMES_273_10	negative	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
ELECTRONICS_208_8	negative	Seems like everyone is getting these issues.
MUSIC_238_5	neutral	The best track on this record is clearly ""Crazy in Love"", an urban love tale that gets you movin' and singing along...but every track after it is a total dissapointment.
BOOKS_168_23	positive	I think it should be read by any serious Bible student as well as any casual Bible reader.
DVDS_199_1	positive	: Keaton shines in his love of the game turn Michael Keaton is one of my favorite (and largely underrated) actors.
VIDEOGAMES_267_1	negative	Newborns can now enjoy Mario Party!
ELECTRONICS_228_3	positive	Also, the unit is about the size of a TV remote and I believe the large size keeps it from walking away.
ELECTRONICS_83_5	positive	DVD's and video games play very well on this television.
ELECTRONICS_85_14	neutral	The camera body seems decent enough, but the plastic dials, especially the menu control, are so sloppy that the camera creaks and rattles as you handle it.
MUSIC_90_4	negative	None of the songs stand out from each other.
ELECTRONICS_73_23	neutral	All functions seem to work appropriately.
VIDEOGAMES_136_31	positive	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
ELECTRONICS_222_4	negative	What bothered me most about all of this was that there was no customer service number that I could call.
VIDEOGAMES_283_5	neutral	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.
BOOKS_163_4	positive	I read the book and like it very much.
VIDEOGAMES_278_7	negative	Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow!
VIDEOGAMES_292_0	positive	""Instant classic"" SSX 3 lets you play one of eight characters.
DVDS_202_4	positive	Along for the ride in one jaunt is Jan (Taylor nicely balancing the destitute of Chinaski with her own unique blend of shabbiness), a loose woman Henry falls for and wind up sharing space and libations until the money runs out.
DVDS_200_5	neutral	Mike is plagued not only with the cluelessness of the execs but is shortchanged when he is forced to go with his second choice for the show's lead character, Zach Harper (newcomer Kranz, suggesting a lame-brained Jake Gyllenhaal); an inept director (Garson); his airhead manager Alice (Greer) who backpedals everything thrown her way; his pregnant wife (Bateman making a nice return to film here) his only support system but a constant reminder of the price of failure; and one lulu of a recurring, crippling back ailment.
ELECTRONICS_72_25	negative	If there is any background lighting, and the room is dark, the camera's flash does not seem to adequately adjust when the camera is set on automatic, resulting in very dark photos.
ELECTRONICS_231_3	positive	Definitely recommend this to anyone looking to get a great LCD for a low price.
BOOKS_168_12	negative	Weak points * The book assumed you knew either a) other authors and references, or b) what different theories (such as JPED) were.
BOOKS_146_9	negative	3. The level of manipulation on the emotional and historical level that the author attempts is flat out insulting to the reader.
VIDEOGAMES_282_16	positive	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
MUSIC_105_2	positive	There are 12 brilliant songs that use live instruments througout the album, This gives the album a happy and feel good characteristic.
VIDEOGAMES_273_7	negative	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
ELECTRONICS_232_12	neutral	The blacks are blacker giving the colors a pop, along with the sheen of the screen - which unfortunately does pick up glare as its not matte - the only downside, besides not having a Bluray. However, by turning up the brightness, I was able to compensate.
DVDS_199_13	positive	DeLillo has a fine gift for his literations and the parallel of Nicky's play - a quasi-autobiography about his relationship with his working class dad - with Nicky's family life shows a man, flawed, yet genuinely wanting to make things work.
VIDEOGAMES_292_3	positive	Also you can buy new tricks.
ELECTRONICS_212_1	negative	But worse than that is the program NEVER completely uninstalled.
ELECTRONICS_225_9	positive	Love the drive...
ELECTRONICS_216_24	positive	6. It's fast!
VIDEOGAMES_288_18	positive	Overall, brilliant execution.
ELECTRONICS_75_3	negative	Downsides are that if you have built-in freeview on your TV, it does get confused sometimes and will refuse to allow you to watch it through either TV or HDD player - I had to mess around with the settings several times to make it stop doing this.
DVDS_187_16	negative	Take for example Marina and Ridley. They exchange two or three lines and a few significant looks and then BANG!
VIDEOGAMES_134_34	negative	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
DVDS_202_9	positive	But again it is Dillon who gives an Oscar worthy turn as the charming, irritable and barely awake Chinaski that deserves recognition proving there is more to meet the eye in the once â€“thought-of-one-trick-pony that Dillon was initially perceived for his heavy Brooklyn accent and blank brooding good looks; he does his best work since changing that tune with ""Drugstore Cowboy"" and hope he continues his trek of good fortune unlike Henry Chinaski.
ELECTRONICS_73_29	negative	On the other hand, I would not recommend this or any other Sony product in light of Sony's exchange policy and poor service.
MUSIC_89_3	negative	Usually Bon Jovi cd's are good but this cd was just crap.
VIDEOGAMES_117_8	negative	The graphics are not all that great.
MUSIC_254_27	neutral	MariÃ© wanted to move away from ""Unfold."" I'll nourish a hope that she keeps moving; on to something different for her third album.
VIDEOGAMES_141_21	neutral	If you can get it for less than 30 bucks, I'll say it's worth it.
DVDS_187_12	neutral	I had no great expectations for Marlon Wayans, but it was his character the one I enjoyed the most (though it was the silliest sidekick Topper Lilien could have come up with) he gave a not very good but desperatley needed comic relief.
VIDEOGAMES_287_17	positive	RPG fan or no, you have no excuse not to play this incredible series.
VIDEOGAMES_274_7	negative	Do youself a favor, get your head's out from where ever you all have stuck them and get with the program, either FreeFalcon or Openfalcon for true realisim and performance.
VIDEOGAMES_136_5	positive	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
DVDS_194_2	positive	But I thought the acting of Ioan Gruffudd was the best for his portrayal of Mr.Fantastic (Reed Richards).
VIDEOGAMES_117_13	negative	Also the vehicle repair tool that you just grind against the side of a car to make it run again.
ELECTRONICS_78_8	positive	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
VIDEOGAMES_291_8	negative	The story is really the same as KH, but they replace ""heart"" with memory.
ELECTRONICS_74_4	positive	The Terk is definitely the best looking of the bunch, and I really like the included stand, which gives you more flexibility in setting it up.
MUSIC_244_16	negative	Giving it two stars is generous, and I wasn't in the mood.
MUSIC_248_2	positive	On disc one you have the beautiful vocals of Barbara Tucker with 'Beautiful People'.
ELECTRONICS_221_4	negative	Also, this accrued during normal usage (browsing, music) second, which was mostly the issue, the battery barely last 2 hours!
VIDEOGAMES_136_1	positive	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
MUSIC_251_7	neutral	For everyone else, it will just be okay.
VIDEOGAMES_139_2	positive	Graphics Abseloutly amazing.
DVDS_197_11	neutral	Although the aspirations of Garcia is a mixed crazy quilt of political intonations and soul-searching empathy he should be proud of delivering something that means something if not to the audience than to himself.
VIDEOGAMES_272_15	negative	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
MUSIC_103_16	negative	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
MUSIC_97_9	neutral	This album is everything that's right and wrong with the 60s music.
BOOKS_152_5	negative	Many details and explanations are left out.
ELECTRONICS_210_7	negative	I spent 3 days on and off trying to down load phone numbers from my motorola v600 cell phone to my laptop with the ambicom inc usb bluetooth adapter.
ELECTRONICS_226_5	positive	The widescreen makes the screen seem so much bigger than my old laptop which was also 15.4"" but not widescreen.
ELECTRONICS_207_8	negative	Another bad part is that this bag has no additional zipper to close the main compartment like most other bags do.
VIDEOGAMES_124_26	negative	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
BOOKS_163_1	positive	It has a lot of rhyming words and some good humor in the story.
BOOKS_153_11	negative	Well, duh, that summarizes just about every bad story ever told.
DVDS_192_8	positive	The characters themselves are immaculately detailed and are representative of their in game counterparts, and the free flowing clothing and hair on each of them will make you say ""wow"" at least once.
BOOKS_170_10	neutral	Other critisisms such as corporations selling products never used in the war might easily be rationalized by asserting anticipated needs, but considering the authors rank, status, 'need to know' position which would involve him in planning such anticipated needs gives sway to the generals conclusions.
MUSIC_86_18	negative	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.
DVDS_190_4	neutral	The great acting was wasted by a camera that made me feel sick, and not drawing me into the action.
DVDS_179_6	negative	No? Didn't think so!
DVDS_192_19	negative	The story centers around Cloud, Tifa, Rude, Reno, and Kadaj for the majority of the film, but they only act to leverage each other to push a one dimensional story along.
VIDEOGAMES_122_2	negative	This is all in a game which claims to let you use ""Real Military Tactics.""
BOOKS_145_3	negative	Most only require the student to know a definition.
BOOKS_175_1	positive	""Leviathan"" weaves fact and fiction together to make a great story.
VIDEOGAMES_289_29	positive	I am looking forward to trying out GC2, but from the reviews, it seems that the major enhancement is the ability to design ships.
DVDS_204_12	positive	Kerrigan films his troubled protagonist at a too-close-for comfort distance in which the hand-held camera gives the theme and film a scary immediacy ; you want to root for Keane but not get that close to the turmoil broiling inside.
VIDEOGAMES_275_14	negative	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...
ELECTRONICS_215_5	positive	The headset itself easily turns on and off (which sounds like a simple function, but wasn't all that easy on my previous two Bluetooths).
BOOKS_148_8	negative	But the Oh, my gosh!
BOOKS_157_10	neutral	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
ELECTRONICS_231_0	neutral	Pros: picture is great, quick setup, lots of inputs Cons: directions can be tricky to figure out This is an amazing TV for the price.
MUSIC_99_2	positive	And Billy--well, of course, of course.
BOOKS_168_18	negative	* I wanted to see a chapter written by Kevin Vanhoozer.
VIDEOGAMES_269_11	negative	You have say ''hit points'' for each weapon, for example: You equip a sword, and it can only be used 15 times before breaking.
VIDEOGAMES_278_5	negative	Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost.
VIDEOGAMES_293_7	positive	So far, so good, I'm as excited as anyone who has played the previous, Itakagi is my man, too bad he is leaving Tecmo but maybe its a good thing since I doubt he will stop making games...
VIDEOGAMES_267_2	negative	Yay! -Use of the microphone!
VIDEOGAMES_126_13	negative	I forgot to mention that weapons in this game are USELESS, don't even bother picking them up.
MUSIC_236_9	negative	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
VIDEOGAMES_123_7	neutral	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
VIDEOGAMES_267_12	negative	That's the only real apeal to this game though, I don't think any more poorly of the Mario Party series for this game....it's just not worth buying...
VIDEOGAMES_279_17	negative	I don't think it's right for EA to expect people to pay $10 more for less content compared to the past console versions.
VIDEOGAMES_123_1	neutral	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
VIDEOGAMES_288_7	positive	Good job Edios!
VIDEOGAMES_137_59	neutral	It's not a really bad game.
VIDEOGAMES_137_3	positive	No, of course not!
MUSIC_238_9	negative	It sounds almost like when you put a tape in a player and it eats the tape, and is just as enjoyable.
BOOKS_158_11	neutral	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
VIDEOGAMES_141_20	positive	However, Mercs 2 was fun, and I did enjoy it.
DVDS_199_2	positive	He hasn't been making a lot of films in the past few years but whenever he pops up you immediately are focused on his kinetic energy, the arched eyebrows not unlike Nicholson's (side note: I always thought it was divine intervention when they were cast in BATMAN since they had so many mirror image physical ties!)
ELECTRONICS_79_2	positive	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
VIDEOGAMES_143_9	negative	The background are bland.
VIDEOGAMES_140_3	positive	Many people claim that the heroes are unbalanced because they are so much better than normal characters, but that is a stupid statement.
ELECTRONICS_217_3	negative	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
MUSIC_107_4	positive	This song is so great.
VIDEOGAMES_132_7	neutral	There are three levels bronze, silver, and gold adding some minimal replay value in that section.
BOOKS_174_4	positive	It just makes sense.
MUSIC_248_5	negative	was FADED OUT after only 4 mins!!!
ELECTRONICS_85_13	negative	An ELPH PowerShot I used years ago felt considerably more solid than this--overall more dense and metallic.
MUSIC_105_6	positive	however dispite this the album is still fantastic and contains the Original NERD flavor.
BOOKS_160_3	neutral	It did not capture my interest as I thought it would, nevertheless I really liked the psychological aspects of how to cope with the death of a beloved one.
VIDEOGAMES_276_4	negative	Original character expressions replaced with medicore digital drawings.
VIDEOGAMES_124_9	negative	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
VIDEOGAMES_278_0	neutral	""Broken"" The Good: Decent story, tons of gore, great graphics and audio, new features are neat The Bad: Abysmal combat, terrible control, extremely slow pace, laughable voice acting I tried so hard to love RE1 and look beyond it's major flaws.
ELECTRONICS_222_5	positive	On the plus side, there are buttons to program for radio stations and this is done like in the car.
VIDEOGAMES_132_11	negative	In truth, I was expecting a lot more than what I got in terms of graphics.
VIDEOGAMES_134_11	negative	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
MUSIC_112_10	positive	Definitely one of the better tracks on the album.
DVDS_189_2	negative	Thomas Allen is a singer I greatly admire - however on this night he just doesn't seem vocally up to the challenge, his aria `Fin ch'han dal vino' Is taken so fast by Muti that he is breathless and seems unable to cope, by the end of the opera he is evidently flagging.
VIDEOGAMES_143_2	positive	The controls are spot on.
VIDEOGAMES_131_5	negative	If you get killed, you have to do it all over again, and again, and again, ... I recommend playing this game at the ""normal"" setting the first time - perhaps then it would have been more fun.
VIDEOGAMES_291_23	positive	Sound Sound... I LOVE THE KH MUSIC!
VIDEOGAMES_288_1	positive	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
MUSIC_259_2	positive	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
DVDS_181_19	negative	Wil Smith's son just gets a C+ and only because he finally delivered on the closing scenes.
MUSIC_112_8	neutral	""Never Let This Go"" is a welcome change of pace to the album, and the melody kind of reminds me of ""The War"" by Melee, though LOOSELY.
VIDEOGAMES_273_6	negative	I want more Diego!""
DVDS_192_10	neutral	Musically, Nobuo Uematsu's talent translates into movie form fairly well, and feature some of the more noteworthy tracks from the game with some original content thrown into the mix.
MUSIC_97_1	positive	The last few intensive notes end this song beautifully.
VIDEOGAMES_136_29	positive	This makes the game even scarier.
DVDS_189_7	positive	The set itself is of highly polished architectural splendour and so in keeping with the period of the opera as indeed are the costumes, not exaggerated or over sumptuous and all the better for that.
VIDEOGAMES_137_1	negative	Don't think this is a true port of the really good SNES game Harvest Moon, because Natsume, the company who created all the HM games, took of the major part of the game: interacting with others.
VIDEOGAMES_118_5	negative	Wow, could have been a expansion pack.
VIDEOGAMES_266_2	positive	I would enjoy it because you would get weapons such as swords and daggers.
VIDEOGAMES_135_7	positive	They definitely improved the sound on the this game compared to banjo kazooie Value- worth every cent!!!
VIDEOGAMES_118_7	negative	If anything this is a crappy version of Halo 3 that comes with a Halo 3 multiplayer disk...
MUSIC_102_4	neutral	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
MUSIC_244_7	negative	After listening to the first disc, I almost felt I had to check my stereo to make sure I didn't have the same song on repeat over and over.
MUSIC_87_5	negative	I encourage you to buy this cd....my copy is available.
MUSIC_235_3	negative	The music contains full of pretentious French lyrics and the beat is flat.
MUSIC_105_8	positive	it takes a small while to get used to the new style but now i relly love ""fly or die"".
ELECTRONICS_224_1	neutral	I specifically chose this model because it was marketed by Canon as fully supporting Macs. My experience with the printer is that 'support' is an exaggeration.
ELECTRONICS_84_3	positive	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
MUSIC_252_10	negative	For example, compare Eric's lame take of ""When You've Got A Good Friend,"" with Savoy Brown's excellent version from their 1999 album Blues Keep Me Holding On. No contest: Guitarist Kim Simmonds and his famous Gibson Flying V fly circles around Eric's rendition.
VIDEOGAMES_291_24	positive	This is good too!!
VIDEOGAMES_277_25	negative	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
VIDEOGAMES_136_35	positive	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
VIDEOGAMES_124_0	negative	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
MUSIC_240_3	negative	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
ELECTRONICS_78_9	positive	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
VIDEOGAMES_132_20	neutral	The game is simply a port from the N64, with not a lot added in, but it is a breath of something from the N64 age.
ELECTRONICS_221_3	negative	it was loud and incomparable.
MUSIC_260_18	positive	Simply godly.
VIDEOGAMES_127_25	negative	That's it for 51 whole events!?
ELECTRONICS_226_9	positive	But that is very minor and the computer is all around a great computer and I would recommend it to everyone who's looking to buy a new computer!!
VIDEOGAMES_134_1	negative	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
VIDEOGAMES_274_6	negative	If ya want emmersion, and overall the highest levels of reality you can get, buy the original Falcon4.0 disk and then go download either FreeFalcon4 from www.freefalcon.com/forums OR Openfalcon 4.5 from: www.f4forums.com/forum The best thing about those 2 sims are 1 - they're free 2 - They're not junk like Falcon4.0 allied Force is.
ELECTRONICS_224_2	neutral	It can be made to work with Macs, but not all the time, and certainly not if they are running Snow Leopard.
VIDEOGAMES_277_15	negative	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
VIDEOGAMES_141_7	negative	The cities are all dark; I suppose from smog and smoke from guns, and cannons, ect.
ELECTRONICS_73_27	negative	The one feature lacking on this model is the inability to copy DVDs to a videotape.
VIDEOGAMES_137_33	positive	People do look like people!
ELECTRONICS_222_3	neutral	I has a nice feature in that there are 2 alarms and you can set each one to go off on certain days of the week but once again I was unable to set the days of the week.
VIDEOGAMES_141_15	negative	I hated them and they stopped me form playing the game over again.
VIDEOGAMES_122_10	negative	No soldier in his right mind would scramble to a fence when being fired on, unless it was his last and only place to try and hide.
DVDS_204_17	positive	The words ""I love you"" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
ELECTRONICS_214_1	negative	This Virtual CD cannot be disabled, unmounted, removed, eradicated, or partitioned away - EVERY!!!!!
MUSIC_112_16	positive	Others Escape"" by Underoath, because the song starts slow, seems to be another basic song just like the last two, but at the end Josh adds some screams and it really makes for a pumped up ending to the album.
MUSIC_258_2	positive	Richard Perlmutter has done it again - this cd is brilliant and has quickly become a beloved cd for our entire family.
VIDEOGAMES_292_10	positive	You also have to beat rivals, explore the mountain, complete every extra bonus missions and collect stickers, drawings and dolls of the characters.
ELECTRONICS_210_10	negative	I will return this one and gladly pay more to get rid of this crap.
VIDEOGAMES_118_4	negative	3 maps...
DVDS_200_3	positive	To wit: veteran scribe Mike Klein (Duchovny giving deadly dead-pan, is a study in noble rot) is desperately trying to get his current project ""The Wexler Chronicles"", a dramedy based in part of his real-life brother's suicide's affect on him, past the pilot stage for the fictitious Panda Network (think CW lite) and the biggest hurdle is vacuous, yet tenaciously 'my way or the highway' Lenny (Weaver, a dry riot), a harpy in a suit, who is not Mike's biggest fan but has her current junior exec Richard McAllister (Gruffudd in a modulated turn of a decent guy in a deceptive business), a Brit late of the BBC, whose come to LA for the network to give a fresh perspective on the new crop of shows for the seasonal line-up.
MUSIC_250_4	neutral	One of the few bright spots in this album was L'Alba del Mondo, an Italian adaptation of Ennio Morricone's â€œI Knew I Loved You (Deborah's Theme).â€? The addition of some more familiar renditions, such as â€œHallelujahâ€? and â€œAmazing Graceâ€? make it more bearable but are not enough to overcome the dreary, one-note atmosphere that plagues the album.
BOOKS_170_7	positive	Although oppinion, the basis of his oppinions are based in factual information and with anticipated counter aurguements addressed in advanced.
ELECTRONICS_73_12	negative	I assured him that my front door doesn't know how to write, and that I still had not received my new unit.
ELECTRONICS_218_4	negative	I have two major complaints about this phone.
VIDEOGAMES_137_43	negative	With 5-6 different tunes in the game, that you keep hearing overâ€¦and overâ€¦andâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦over!!
DVDS_192_9	positive	The effects in the action segments are noteworthy as well, featuring vibrant colors and creative lighting.
VIDEOGAMES_136_0	positive	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
VIDEOGAMES_117_16	negative	Also the multiplayer sucks, blow up gold crates....
VIDEOGAMES_282_19	positive	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.
ELECTRONICS_229_7	positive	I would highly recommend this to all.
VIDEOGAMES_269_17	negative	But with FFL2, the music just is so repetitive, and melancholy, even during the ''happy'' parts of this game.
MUSIC_99_1	positive	Wilco too.
VIDEOGAMES_137_20	neutral	You can have a little fun riding your horse, if you like thatâ€¦
MUSIC_107_21	positive	:D Anyways, overall this is a great album and Venus Malone has a great voice.
VIDEOGAMES_294_7	positive	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.
VIDEOGAMES_284_1	neutral	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
MUSIC_92_3	negative	Extremely bland performance from Eddie (three note riff on Don't Tell Me?)
VIDEOGAMES_273_11	negative	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.
VIDEOGAMES_143_5	positive	The ability to chose the dark side or light side through random killing or giving a way money is beautiful.
VIDEOGAMES_124_18	negative	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
DVDS_178_27	neutral	Had it been a made-for-TV movie, I would have given it at least a 7/10 because it was (again) lacking in everything except acting and atmosphere.
BOOKS_168_24	positive	I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
MUSIC_260_19	positive	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
MUSIC_109_5	positive	No longer does the music feel constrained by the mono recording.
ELECTRONICS_225_8	negative	I also noticed a marked slowdown on the machine with the active backup software monitoring in the background.
DVDS_192_26	neutral	Artistically, it does hold it's own, but venture out of this realm and the flaws are apparent.
ELECTRONICS_219_2	negative	Unfortunately, it lacks some capabilities a lot of ordinary Mac users will want - primarily the ability to sync data among multiple Macs. If you keep Bento on your desktop you can't readily sync its data to the same app on your laptop, or vice versa.
VIDEOGAMES_276_20	negative	We are still out here and you have ruined the artistic integrity for this game.
DVDS_179_3	negative	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
ELECTRONICS_220_0	negative	This product works ok, but potential buyers should be aware of these issues: 1. The auto-orientation feature does not seem to work at all, despite me checking that it is enabled and resaving the settings several times.
ELECTRONICS_79_6	positive	Works wonderfully.
BOOKS_153_9	negative	No story.
DVDS_187_9	negative	there are a LOT of plot holes.
VIDEOGAMES_123_6	negative	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
VIDEOGAMES_132_14	neutral	Unlock able characters and medals add some replay value.
MUSIC_242_12	negative	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
MUSIC_103_6	negative	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings ""Since You've Been Gone...."" is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
ELECTRONICS_74_5	positive	The antenna feels well-made and solid, the cables appear to be of a good quality.
BOOKS_149_5	negative	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
MUSIC_261_9	positive	Just buy it and you'll understand.
ELECTRONICS_72_15	negative	So I tried a couple other stores in the area, still no luck.
DVDS_181_8	negative	Now let's talk about the flaws.
MUSIC_109_4	positive	Hearing these tunes in REAL STEREO for the first time is a true revelation.
DVDS_177_3	negative	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
ELECTRONICS_225_7	negative	not that its done it should be very quick, but 2 days???
BOOKS_169_16	positive	moment as I found something that related both to business practices, and my personal relationships.
MUSIC_242_11	negative	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
MUSIC_251_4	negative	Also, how many times is Dieselboy going to have mixes of ""Follow the Leader"" and ""You Must Follow"" on his albums.
BOOKS_148_10	negative	I'd easily figured out what the puzzle was before turning the page.
VIDEOGAMES_291_13	negative	Gameplay The gameplay in battles are weird!!
BOOKS_155_4	positive	It has all of the Koontz humor and quirky dialog.
MUSIC_263_0	positive	They are so great and they give Atlanta a good reputation.
ELECTRONICS_223_0	positive	The webcam works as advertised - with really crappy lighting, it still managed to show my face comfortably, and worked well with various messaging software.
VIDEOGAMES_288_3	positive	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
MUSIC_109_0	positive	If you like the Who and have a CD player capable of playing NON-HYBRID SACDs, then this one is a no-brainer.
VIDEOGAMES_275_4	negative	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
DVDS_183_7	neutral	Will has merit but in this flimsy script with walk ons by Cain & Maclaine that added literally nadda, what can be said.
VIDEOGAMES_275_6	negative	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
ELECTRONICS_215_3	positive	Makes the headset easy to carry along with cellphone, without throwing it in my purse and accidentally having it turn on and call back the last number dialed.
DVDS_177_8	negative	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
ELECTRONICS_233_3	negative	I also have excessive noise when I talk and have phone in my pocket while walking.
VIDEOGAMES_137_37	negative	Score: 9/10 Musicâ€“ In one word: repetitive!!
ELECTRONICS_209_5	negative	I'll never buy another moto
MUSIC_86_11	negative	The songs really never come to life.
BOOKS_170_14	positive	Credibility of the author is based in the duration of his career and notariaty.
VIDEOGAMES_272_7	neutral	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
VIDEOGAMES_272_6	neutral	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
DVDS_181_21	negative	It just ain't worth it.
VIDEOGAMES_269_12	negative	Now, of course, as you continue onwards, you find that weapons become even more expensive, and slowly begin having less, and less hit points, so when you do want to ''level'' up, you have to get new weapons every several battles, just to keep leveling up, which takes all your gold, which means to do anything else you need to go fight....
ELECTRONICS_225_3	positive	The software they provide is pretty...
DVDS_181_7	negative	After today's waste of time & money I have to agree.
ELECTRONICS_219_0	positive	Bento is a smart, convenient database for the non-power user.
VIDEOGAMES_124_6	negative	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
VIDEOGAMES_283_1	negative	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
ELECTRONICS_217_7	neutral	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.
MUSIC_242_8	neutral	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
VIDEOGAMES_122_6	negative	Basically, you cannot crawl on the ground or go prone, so using dips in the terrain is not too common.
VIDEOGAMES_134_80	negative	This game could have been prevented.
VIDEOGAMES_288_17	positive	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
ELECTRONICS_75_0	neutral	Bought this based on previous reviews and is generally a good player.
DVDS_183_4	negative	I doubt if they see just how bad an actor Will Ferrell and how over the top his shenanigans become ""overkill"".
VIDEOGAMES_124_15	negative	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
VIDEOGAMES_277_10	positive	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
VIDEOGAMES_285_13	positive	The gunshots are...near perfect.....there is even some villains that taunt you during the major killage which you inflict on the fiends....Then the music...Your very great western music!
ELECTRONICS_208_3	negative	You're not able to search for your friends, sync your email contacts, you get errors when syncing in with facebook and twitter.
VIDEOGAMES_129_13	negative	Everyone else should steer clear.
VIDEOGAMES_276_19	negative	I wish that NIS America had done more polls to fans to ask what we wanted.
VIDEOGAMES_285_3	positive	A nice western-cartoon feel!
MUSIC_262_2	positive	A little more intensity would not hurt this album, BUT it is a good one.
DVDS_192_15	negative	The choreography in these scenes doesn't lend itself well to physics either, where barriers such as gravity and an individual's physical strength are breakable at the character's convenience.
DVDS_178_4	negative	Everything in between is a bunch of garbage.
BOOKS_147_10	negative	The tragedy is uninformed persons will read and repeat Frymire's errors, and as a result will confuse the whole subject area.
MUSIC_114_2	positive	A first-time listener might guess this was an undiscovered gem originating from London, circa 1968. From then on, it becomes a game of ""spot-the-reference"".
MUSIC_248_4	negative	To my surprise 'Who Keeps Changing Your Mind?'
ELECTRONICS_210_8	negative	No luck & no support.
VIDEOGAMES_123_4	negative	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
VIDEOGAMES_279_4	positive	The arenas, player models, crowds, coaches, lighting, and presentation are all the best I've ever seen in a basketball game.
VIDEOGAMES_131_1	negative	But this game is way too long and repetitious.
ELECTRONICS_212_6	negative	My real rating is -5 stars.
MUSIC_86_8	positive	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
MUSIC_114_12	positive	It's a diverse album, moody, brilliant and completely satisfying.
VIDEOGAMES_117_19	negative	Anyways, maybe I am just spoiled from Halo and COD4. But it feels like they rushed this game out.
BOOKS_162_5	negative	It's not just the footnotes, some of which were reprinted, some of which weren't.
MUSIC_112_1	positive	My friends love it, my little brother loves it, my parents love it - you will too!
BOOKS_161_6	negative	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
VIDEOGAMES_144_8	negative	Not enough bugs that I wouldn't recommend to buy it, based on the fact that it works fairly well for me.
MUSIC_242_5	negative	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
DVDS_187_15	negative	Then there's Thora Birch... who I would like to nominate as this years Jar Jar Blinks... it's difficult to think this is the same person from ""American Beauty"" The character development is another big mess!
ELECTRONICS_227_7	positive	Even a little child will take beautiful pictures with this camera if he/she is able to set it to AUTO. But like all electronic equipment, (LCD, HDTV, TV monitors, and digcams), you have to adjust the controls (PICT.ADJ) to get the best picture, or a picture set to your personal preference; you know-contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc... well, the FZ30 has controls that when adjusted properly, practically eliminates the so called 'noise' problem.
ELECTRONICS_216_19	positive	2. The pictures are amazingly clear.
MUSIC_90_0	negative	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
VIDEOGAMES_132_19	neutral	The game is a lot of fun to play, especially since it is not grounded as Mario Kart DS is, but the game is extremely short.
VIDEOGAMES_125_16	positive	The only way you will get enjoyment out of this is by doing the tournament with friends.
ELECTRONICS_216_20	positive	3. The auto-focus is next-to-perfect.
DVDS_191_18	negative	We have the black cat, lousy score, the Trinity kick, the oracles home (with her in it), cookies, and so on.
ELECTRONICS_224_5	positive	To be fair, the MF6595 works flawlessly with all Windows operating systems, including Windows 7 Release Candidate.
VIDEOGAMES_141_6	negative	However, towards the end of the game the graphics start to suck.
MUSIC_88_2	negative	First, this is not a 2007 new release, is an old collection of songs from the 70's and the 80's Don't let them fool you with Jose Jose's intros for every song, where he can bearly breath do to his affected voice.
BOOKS_152_4	negative	Her true intention of her mission is to achieve closure before starting her new life, marrying her love Randy. Her story is too long and drawn out.
MUSIC_255_5	neutral	This album is not as good nor accessible, but remains an enjoyable, second best.
VIDEOGAMES_292_9	positive	You can unlock every tournament there is and still you are not finished.
DVDS_205_14	positive	Black's sharp, skewered and outrageous humor percolates like a heady witches' brew of goofy insouciance effortlessly in the hardboiled tradition of Raymond Chandler which he spoofs with the wry narration Downey does throughout and upending the apple cart of the pulpy fiction noir genre with gleeful gusto.
DVDS_191_29	neutral	But well worth a watch since it marks a new low in the art of commercial-cinema, but this point of what seems to be of no return will be cast a-side when the third episode of Star Wars will hit the ultimate bottom.
MUSIC_238_13	negative	If you want to hear Beyonce Knowles at her best, buy any of the three Destiny's Child album, and don't bother with an album that sounds like 40 songs had a car accident.
MUSIC_88_3	negative	It's sad that sush an talented artist like him can be manipulated by Record Company that only cares about business (money).
MUSIC_108_6	positive	anywayz, every one of these songs on the ceedee is gud.
MUSIC_251_3	neutral	Sorry he is a good DJ to see live, but he has put out a lot better work like Project Human, the 6ixth Session, and System Upgrade.
VIDEOGAMES_121_3	negative	Basically the horses control like they have ice skates on.
DVDS_176_7	negative	This mpvie is the pits..
MUSIC_261_4	positive	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
MUSIC_114_7	positive	Though Scrapbook resembles 60s psychedelia, it doesn't feel dated in the least; this is no doubt due to the updated post-rock guitar sound that appears throughout.
ELECTRONICS_232_0	positive	Pros: Everything - seriously - stop looking and buy this.
VIDEOGAMES_142_8	positive	Play as top WWF Superstars including newcomers Rob Van Dam, Booker T, DDP,Hurricane, and now thq has said that Kevin Nash and Scott Hall and Hollywood Hulk Hogan that's right the NWO will be in the game now.
VIDEOGAMES_134_6	neutral	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
ELECTRONICS_80_0	neutral	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
VIDEOGAMES_143_3	neutral	Wile combat only slows a bit.
ELECTRONICS_223_4	negative	And after that, she did not even bother to try out anything on my computer.
VIDEOGAMES_289_6	negative	Just when you think you got it figured out, you will get hit upside the head, or start a game with tougher enemies that just kill you.
DVDS_183_0	negative	Nichole was the only saving grace to this (simply put) FLOP!!
MUSIC_245_6	neutral	I recommend ""The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greated Hits"" (MCA) - sold here at Amazon too - it is packed with all original versions and has really great liner notes.
MUSIC_113_3	positive	I was so wrong.
VIDEOGAMES_273_5	negative	""I already played this story.
ELECTRONICS_212_0	negative	grainy photos, slow jerky movement.
DVDS_190_6	negative	Then, on the other hand, the longest close-ups, of Ralph Fiennes' face, lingered so long and so pointlessly.
ELECTRONICS_216_29	neutral	A good analogy for this camera is this: This camera is like an expensive new Mercades that automatically chooses the brake and acceleration settings for you and doesn't do a good job of it.
VIDEOGAMES_283_2	negative	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
VIDEOGAMES_120_4	negative	That was nothing but a pu$$y move on their part...
DVDS_205_17	positive	Monaghan proves also to hold her own and has a deft comic timing too and being easy on the eyes sure as hell doesn't hurt.
MUSIC_109_3	positive	What I can tell you is that this release beats the pants off of any incarnation of this recording from the past.
MUSIC_239_3	neutral	Hot Tracks: Balla Baby Make That Ass Talk Don't You Worry All the Way to St. Lou 26's Don't Really Care The rest of the tracks are way below what my expectations were.
BOOKS_168_22	positive	You could return to it for information over and over again.
DVDS_185_3	negative	Where you relate and bond with Love Actually you tend to scratch your head wondering what the heck is going on.
MUSIC_107_14	positive	10. Eye on the prize - 5/5stars i give this five stars just because i like the chorus part.
MUSIC_104_1	positive	funny as hell but i also liked the music.
VIDEOGAMES_265_1	negative	I had an urge to play again and only kept it on for 5 minutes because of how bored I was.
VIDEOGAMES_140_14	neutral	It seems like other games have either little micro needed or too much, but this game finds a happy median.
ELECTRONICS_226_3	positive	Also the media keys are very conveinent when listening to music or watching a movie.
MUSIC_107_11	negative	I don't really feel for this one.
BOOKS_172_12	positive	Would-be writers: avoid at your peril.
BOOKS_146_10	negative	Again, I was outraged.
BOOKS_162_0	neutral	This book gives a comprehensive and readable, if somewhat formally written overview of classical economics, reflecting the state of the field in 1848. As may be expected of a book 150+ years old, much of its content is outdated today.
DVDS_185_6	negative	Not every film is a ""10"" but Lord please spare me the 1 thru 3's.
ELECTRONICS_208_2	negative	If you're looking to upload your runs and share with friends and all that greatness that Nike makes is seem to be, then don't waste your time.
VIDEOGAMES_117_7	negative	Ok first off it seems like my guys top speed is a breath taking 2 mph, 3 mph if I am sprinting.
VIDEOGAMES_132_0	positive	""Been there, done that"" Diddy's back and better than ever!
VIDEOGAMES_134_14	negative	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
DVDS_199_3	positive	and glib, self-deprecating wit that acts as a shield from his inner demons his characters often try to keep at bay.
DVDS_180_0	negative	What a waste of celluloid but wait!!
VIDEOGAMES_121_2	negative	The game is jerky, the blood effects are straight outta mortal kombat, combat is so ridiculous that boars and wolves make you their **** But by far the worst part has to be horse riding.
VIDEOGAMES_140_0	positive	Without a doubt the most well designed game I have yet played.
ELECTRONICS_229_1	positive	Set-up took 10 minutes and I didn't need support from Slingbox.
VIDEOGAMES_130_4	negative	Nothing like spending 10minutes blasting through soldiers then all of a sudden when your about to hit the end you get jumped by 3 soldiers out of nowhere and you have to start 10 minutes back and do everything all over again.
BOOKS_157_2	positive	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
VIDEOGAMES_124_4	negative	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
MUSIC_249_7	neutral	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
BOOKS_153_8	negative	He is is no quirkier or more matter-of-fact than half the people I know.
VIDEOGAMES_141_19	negative	There's just nothing to do at a lot of the places.
MUSIC_98_3	negative	In is a little unsettling.
VIDEOGAMES_277_13	negative	You have now mastered the fighting game.
MUSIC_249_6	negative	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
ELECTRONICS_84_1	positive	It works great for that and much more.
ELECTRONICS_85_11	negative	The real disappointment here is the build quality.
MUSIC_105_9	positive	basically you eaither like it or you dont, but you will never know until you try it...SO wot ru wating for get your copy now before they all sell out!!!!!!
BOOKS_152_2	neutral	I think she had a good story idea and then along the way it seemed that she lost her focus.
MUSIC_246_3	negative	There is no way that ""Puppy Love"" or ""Diana"" can sound the same when sung by a 21 year old man as they do when sung by a 14 year old superprodigy whose voice hasn't changed.
MUSIC_241_8	negative	Sorry Herb, but I think you missed the boat with this series.
MUSIC_239_0	negative	Chingy's followup to 2003's ""The Jackpot"" falls disasterously lower than his debut.
VIDEOGAMES_287_8	positive	-A horde of sidequests that can distract you from the main story-path for hours on end.
ELECTRONICS_226_6	positive	The WiFi connected to the internet instantly and the bluetooth helped me trannsfer my pictures and videos from my phone onto my computer.
BOOKS_148_4	negative	By flagrantly violating narrative intrusion, making it obvious to the reader and by claiming that she believes herself to be an actual blood descendant of Mary Magdalene and that this is all some fictionalized recounting of events that she alleges have happened to her, she shows that she just doesn't get it.
VIDEOGAMES_124_14	negative	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
MUSIC_91_2	negative	On this one they're just depressed.
VIDEOGAMES_137_4	positive	It's still a great game, but not the best HM game ever made: they could have made it better.
VIDEOGAMES_283_4	negative	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
DVDS_199_12	positive	Smartly shot on location in Manhattan the city acts as a character as it normally does providing just enough backdrop to its proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_230_5	positive	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
DVDS_201_5	negative	While director Louis Leterrier attempts to give the old-school flick a 21st century CGI kick in the pants (and odes to Ray Harryhausen's original creatures featured particularly the gi-normous scorpion battle royale) the script by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay & Matt Manredi is stilted to the wooden proceedings at hand.
ELECTRONICS_74_6	neutral	I'm reasonably happy with my purchase, even though it was more expensive than others, but I'm not blown away.
VIDEOGAMES_280_8	positive	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
DVDS_181_9	negative	Keanu was so one dimensional that it became boring.
VIDEOGAMES_278_10	negative	They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad.
MUSIC_248_3	positive	From there, there are sure-fire classics from Kim English, De'Lacy, Lovetribe, Bucketheads and Basement Jaxx. Disc two includes some of my personal classics from Njoi, My Friend Sam and after months of trying to find 'Perfect Motion' in it's entirity it ends up on this collection, which I have to take my hat off to HK for.
ELECTRONICS_223_3	negative	It took twenty more minutes for the support rep to get all my information - 20, I kid you not.
VIDEOGAMES_140_8	positive	The first is the Artificial Intelligence, which is amazing.
VIDEOGAMES_142_9	positive	Compete in six different venues including SmackDown!, Raw and the ultimate extravaganza, WrestleMania.
ELECTRONICS_220_3	neutral	2. There should be more photo alignment choices.
VIDEOGAMES_282_9	positive	The game has a very easy learning curve.
VIDEOGAMES_132_17	negative	Sadly, some aspects of the multiplayer require you to unlock battle modes and things of that nature.
ELECTRONICS_78_6	positive	The camera is light but feels solid.
MUSIC_94_7	positive	i think it's much better than the original song...
VIDEOGAMES_134_73	negative	The story was poorly developed and executed.
ELECTRONICS_73_26	neutral	After some time, I found I could get used to the remote.
MUSIC_257_7	positive	This album is it for 2000!
BOOKS_160_2	neutral	It was interesting, nice to read a different perspective than we are used to.
MUSIC_101_1	positive	This DVD is as good as you can buy when it comes to The Smiths. It features a selection of TOTP appearences (which are obviously mimed), some music videos and a strange compilation at the end.
VIDEOGAMES_141_5	positive	Good graphics.
ELECTRONICS_74_10	negative	If you wanted to use a custom length of coaxial cable (in my case, I would have like to use shorter cables), or damaged the AC adapter and needed to replace it, you're pretty much out of luck, save for taking the unit apart and rewiring it.
MUSIC_96_4	negative	I don't think so.
ELECTRONICS_83_1	negative	... Cons: Weighs nearly 250 pounds!
MUSIC_98_6	negative	Also gone is the low thump of the bass drum.
DVDS_198_5	positive	Arguably the best of the Batman films and highly entertaining; what more can you ask for when you see a flying Batman soar over the glassy plains of Gotham!
DVDS_193_7	neutral	However, if you make me analyze it, ok, it's riddled with plot holes, dropped threads, unanswered questions, implausabilities, etc, but that really doesn't matter if the movie succeeds in entertaining me.
VIDEOGAMES_127_22	negative	Playing through adventure to unlock stuff gets really tedious, as it's LONG. So does event mode.
VIDEOGAMES_139_7	neutral	Overall The best in the series, but its not ground breaking.
DVDS_178_1	negative	Until I saw the movie!
MUSIC_241_2	negative	And after all these years, we STILL get ""Mexican Shuffle"" in MONO!
ELECTRONICS_73_24	negative	I agree with other reviewers who have said that the remote control has small buttons and is confusing to use.
ELECTRONICS_230_7	positive	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
VIDEOGAMES_290_10	positive	10/10 Controls: You'll find yourself mostly using the stylus for this game, by throwing things, rubbing your stylus on your dog's head to pet them, and showing them how to do tricks.
BOOKS_161_7	negative	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
BOOKS_157_15	neutral	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.
BOOKS_170_9	negative	The weakness of some aurguments, such as limited resources may have contributed to corporate financial gains are eliminated by comparing profits on historical trends prior to the conflicts.
MUSIC_94_0	negative	the cure song is total rubbish...
ELECTRONICS_213_10	negative	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
MUSIC_256_5	positive	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
MUSIC_106_2	positive	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
MUSIC_99_4	neutral	Gosh. It's all very good music, and even though I cringe with anything remotely of Western twang, I recognize this album is dripping with talent . . . but, it's just to *plain* of an album.
ELECTRONICS_230_11	positive	They also look great next to my 20"" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.
VIDEOGAMES_277_22	negative	Well, time to try again.
MUSIC_256_4	positive	The result is anything but ordinary.
MUSIC_103_9	negative	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
BOOKS_162_4	negative	But I have to agree with the earlier reviewer: don't read it in this edition!
VIDEOGAMES_266_9	negative	The fist boss was Anubus and another was medusa, so the creators just threw in some Greek gods with the Egyptian ones!
MUSIC_258_3	positive	There is nothing better than listening to my children hum classical music and sing the lyrics to these great masterpieces!
MUSIC_257_2	positive	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
VIDEOGAMES_285_18	positive	In conclusion, I give this game an 8/10....It's a really good game....seriously....The best western game I've ever played....It's got a nice story (for an fps), and all sorts of other junk...This is the game for any western shoot em up lover or just a regular action/FPS lover....Hell, it's even good for people who aren't fans of the genre
BOOKS_170_33	negative	The titles subtext of ""Anti-war classic"" is a bit misleading.
MUSIC_244_13	neutral	I forced myself through the whole thing just to say I gave it a shot.
VIDEOGAMES_124_23	negative	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
ELECTRONICS_210_6	negative	Their web site has a section for trouble shooting but this product is not on the list.
BOOKS_153_7	negative	He also says plenty of wrong stuff.
MUSIC_261_3	positive	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
BOOKS_169_3	positive	I really enjoyed this book.
DVDS_176_5	negative	But the story line is incredibly hollow..You keep wondering when will things start making sense...
MUSIC_253_14	neutral	I do hope Commissioned can put together another reunion album (original members only) and sing the songs that wasn't recorded on the reunion project like Learn To Pray, If My People, He Set Me Free, I'm Gonna Let My Love Flow, I Will Never Leave You, and sing the full version of Strange Land . . . . I could go on and on.
MUSIC_88_1	negative	This is not only a big disappointment; This is big disrespect for Jose Jose's fans.
DVDS_189_8	neutral	This is a fairly enjoyable evenings viewing but I was left feeling slightly cheated and wanting to strangle the stage director.
DVDS_205_11	positive	Enter equally unlikely meet-cute Harmony Faith Lane (the luscious Monahan, who makes a sexy funny performance cook to perfection) a childhood friend from Harry's past who shows up at a party that both Harry and Perry are attending for Shaw. Seems Lane has always pursued her dream to be an actress and ever since they were kids playing magician and assistant (guess who and guess who) she came to La-La-Land with little fanfare and a broken heart.
DVDS_188_22	neutral	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
VIDEOGAMES_294_4	positive	That being said, NBA Live 10 is fan-freakin-tastic!
VIDEOGAMES_276_23	positive	It is also nice to enjoy extra features after gameplay.
MUSIC_246_4	neutral	Go for the other compilation listed here that features the original recording.
ELECTRONICS_210_1	negative	purchased 12-17-04 for $32.46 at Comp USA in San Bruno Ca. and still cant get it to work properly.
MUSIC_112_13	neutral	The songs aren't going to win any awards from ""lyric-lovers"", but they are, as the entire album has been, catchy.
ELECTRONICS_73_15	negative	A week later, still no replacement unit.
VIDEOGAMES_136_2	neutral	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
MUSIC_236_18	neutral	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
DVDS_194_4	positive	She still looked hot though.
DVDS_195_7	negative	On top of this, there are no interesting new revelations about Hudson (or about a Hollywood lavender underworld).
ELECTRONICS_222_1	negative	I could not get it to set the time automatically.
DVDS_192_23	neutral	All in all AV doesn't reach anywhere near the bar that FFVII left for itself.
VIDEOGAMES_134_75	negative	At least Squall had an angle to him.
VIDEOGAMES_117_3	positive	I am also a big fan of shooting the trees down.
VIDEOGAMES_136_22	positive	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
MUSIC_260_16	positive	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
ELECTRONICS_226_4	positive	The design is pretty cool and it is available in a variety of colors.
MUSIC_110_6	positive	You will NOT be disappointed.
VIDEOGAMES_134_57	negative	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
MUSIC_250_2	neutral	The music is beautiful, but alarmingly soporific and tedious.
MUSIC_96_5	negative	Perhaps I'm jaded, but now much of this album sounds pretty silly (as does a lot of the music I proudly own from that era).
VIDEOGAMES_134_18	negative	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
VIDEOGAMES_277_5	negative	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
ELECTRONICS_78_7	positive	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
VIDEOGAMES_289_5	negative	Also, your diplomatic actions and nice foreign relations may or may not pay off, so it is difficult to figure out a winning strategy.
MUSIC_254_15	negative	The acoustic production that made her stand out has been replaced with drum machines, multi-layering, and auto-tuning.
ELECTRONICS_207_13	negative	Pay a few dollars more and get a better bag.
DVDS_205_7	neutral	This sure as hell ain't.
BOOKS_167_0	positive	Economic Revolution - A Spiritual Solution by J. Kendall Anderson, M.Ed. [...] With the economy in the tank and President Obama working harder than a Jamaican cook, this book is just what the recession ordered.
VIDEOGAMES_117_10	negative	Some of the things they put in the game to be clever are just stupid.
MUSIC_264_8	positive	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
BOOKS_146_1	negative	It was terrible.
VIDEOGAMES_144_1	positive	Huge world with beautiful graphics.
BOOKS_169_12	neutral	It would have been nice to see a link between gender-specific sales practices and proper Christian ethics.
DVDS_204_21	positive	Emphatically one of the year's best films and one that you need to seek out for the performance of the year.
BOOKS_161_5	negative	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
DVDS_188_30	neutral	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
DVDS_191_27	negative	When will this stop, when can they put more out of that production-value into the films, it says here in the Trivia-section they spent 2 months working on a raindrop, why couldn't they spend that time re-working the script I ask?
VIDEOGAMES_127_20	neutral	The sound effects are OK, but a lot are the same as they were for SSBM. The unrealistic sounds make the fights sound strange, but it's not like that matters.
VIDEOGAMES_136_30	positive	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
VIDEOGAMES_275_8	negative	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
VIDEOGAMES_270_0	negative	look i bought this game one day and with in 2 days i had beaten it 3 times on the hardest difficulty.
ELECTRONICS_214_6	negative	Nor will I buy another in the future out of fear of getting the same results.
ELECTRONICS_80_3	neutral	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
VIDEOGAMES_281_1	negative	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
VIDEOGAMES_281_8	neutral	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
MUSIC_103_10	positive	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
VIDEOGAMES_277_21	negative	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
MUSIC_95_9	neutral	I think Beef Jerky. Overall, I think this band is pretty chopped, but I don't think the licks are wet enough.
MUSIC_105_7	positive	i am very hapy with this cd and i think you will be to.
MUSIC_254_17	neutral	Given the current state of mainstream music, she now blends in. I don't know why MariÃ© would want to sound like so many other young women in the pop market.
ELECTRONICS_85_26	neutral	There's certainly better cameras out there (the G11 is only marginally more expensive), but none I'd want to haul around on a daily basis.
DVDS_186_1	neutral	But, with Ridley Scott, it should have been much, much better.
MUSIC_103_11	positive	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
VIDEOGAMES_278_6	negative	The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.
VIDEOGAMES_271_14	negative	It cannot be played at high graphics even with a very high quality PC. I don't think they can even patch the thing to playability because of the graphic issues that may not be fixable.
MUSIC_243_0	negative	Not sure why they would release this album in this shape.
VIDEOGAMES_287_12	negative	For this reason I'd put off installing the expansions until you're at a point when you can make use of the expansion content (basically end-game or when you reach the experience-cap).
MUSIC_95_3	negative	So, anyway, the bass line sounds like it is so chromatic, it is so inside, and it completely matches with the melody.
MUSIC_264_4	positive	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
DVDS_178_6	negative	But there are only two individuals that this Tooth Fairy is after.
BOOKS_166_1	positive	Wohlforth cheerfully tackles the deep fog of climate science (even some of the career scientists he interviews seem hopelessly befuddled by the complexity of it).
ELECTRONICS_229_2	neutral	I can access and control my television inside or outside my home.
BOOKS_166_6	positive	Getting and telling the story is what Wohlforth knows how to do.
MUSIC_259_4	positive	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
VIDEOGAMES_278_1	negative	Flaws such as the abysmal combat system.
BOOKS_155_7	neutral	The heroine, Susan, doesn't have a large role in the book but you gotta love her stoic attitude.
MUSIC_99_9	negative	If you're looking for *Summerteeth* Wilco or ""Sexuality"" Bragg, this ain't the album to buy.
ELECTRONICS_208_0	negative	It's now April 2010 and for over 6 months now, [...] has yet to get this ish together.
DVDS_178_16	neutral	Darkness Falls should have been a Made-For-TV movie and rated TV-14 Considering how cheap the budget is for made-for-TV movies, Darkness Falls would have fit right in. I probably would've accepted it, or had more respect for it, and given it a much higher rating.
ELECTRONICS_85_25	positive	Overall this is an excellent camera that puts all the functions I wanted (RAW shooting, wide lens, full suite of manual settings and f-stop adjustments) and then some in my back pocket.
DVDS_189_6	neutral	Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Ann Murray whose top notes are squally and jarr the ear, however her lower register is still lovely and she is a very good actress, able to communicate her anguish, her aria `Mi tradi quell'alma ingrata `is very touching.
MUSIC_252_11	negative	And the remake of ""Hellhound on My Trail,"" Johnson's signature tune??
ELECTRONICS_207_5	negative	They broke after only a few times using it, just by normal open and closing.
VIDEOGAMES_271_12	negative	The graphic problems alone make the game almost unplayable.
DVDS_187_18	negative	Plus Ridley (who's name is all the information we get from him) is suddenly very unaware of how ""gifted"" he is, and is choosen out of the blue to save the universe.
VIDEOGAMES_142_0	positive	The greatest spectacle in sports-entertainment is back!
DVDS_177_11	negative	And the naked girl....
VIDEOGAMES_282_12	positive	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
VIDEOGAMES_116_2	negative	Every game seems to have 10 or so ""intro"" screens that you have to go through.
VIDEOGAMES_273_8	negative	Especially not any over 3 years old.
VIDEOGAMES_285_9	positive	Controls: 10/10 Your usual for a FPS.....You get your regular fire, then a special fire which can make you shoot faster on some guns...you also got your open doors button...then your move buttons...and map...and jump...and so on.
VIDEOGAMES_285_10	positive	You really can't complain about the controls, since you can modify them to your liking.
VIDEOGAMES_137_55	negative	Surely you will look for more challenge, if you have played until the fourth year (I didn't) you should be bored by now.
ELECTRONICS_213_3	negative	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
MUSIC_111_3	positive	For this presentation of the career-enhancing LP this turned out to be, Warner and Ezrin have done a terrific job with the original elements.
DVDS_191_4	negative	Since I'm studying philosophy at the university I've found it quite interesting to laugh out load at the symbolism in The Matrix series.
MUSIC_112_4	neutral	""Pressure"" has the surefire sound of a ready for MTV single, and will definitely have a lot of kids heads bobbing at Warped Tour and on their headlining tour this summer.
VIDEOGAMES_119_4	negative	How this is considered the best game of all times is beyond me.
VIDEOGAMES_134_20	negative	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
ELECTRONICS_215_8	neutral	Actually, this does make problem 1 less of a nuisance--since the headset time is shorteded by the BT's refusal to stay in the conversation.
DVDS_185_1	negative	Story is everything with the help of clever dialog but none was to be found in this tragedy for lovers.
VIDEOGAMES_290_0	positive	""Just plain fun"" I don't see why this game got a lower score than the other Nintendogs.
ELECTRONICS_220_5	neutral	I think it could do with auto-fit vertical and auto-fit horizontal features to remedy this.
VIDEOGAMES_141_3	positive	You go running around soaking up hundreds of bullets, and killing or destroying anything near you.
MUSIC_236_14	negative	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself ""You know what would be great?
VIDEOGAMES_120_6	negative	Yeah, you really showed them...
MUSIC_107_8	positive	This song is SO GOOD. Possibly my favorite song on the album along with Cliche 7. Ain't Home Tonight - 4/5 stars.
ELECTRONICS_215_10	neutral	No.
ELECTRONICS_230_2	negative	There's no treble control on the unit.
ELECTRONICS_218_9	negative	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
MUSIC_254_16	negative	The delicate, vine-laden garden lattice of ""Unfold"" has been replaced by a hard, brick wall of sound this time out.
VIDEOGAMES_134_0	neutral	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
VIDEOGAMES_281_5	negative	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
VIDEOGAMES_269_2	neutral	Graphics : 5/10 Probably one of the nicest parts of the entire game, the graphics are nothing amazing, but nothing extremely horrible.
ELECTRONICS_216_7	negative	After hundreds of pictures and a week of giving it every chance to prove itself, I gave up.
MUSIC_102_0	positive	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for ""Je t'ai dans la peau"" (""I've got you under my skin"").
BOOKS_166_2	positive	But he approaches it both as a journalist who makes his living by storytelling, and as a father used to gently encouraging his four bright, curious children to understand their world.
BOOKS_147_4	negative	Frymire is appallingly ignorant of the creationism movement and this fact shows on almost every page.
MUSIC_236_19	negative	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
MUSIC_114_10	positive	The albums opus is ""Sea Map"", which straddles some nether-ground between Led Zeppelin, Bardo Pond and Porcupine Tree. This is balanced by the delicate beauty of ""Scrapbook of Madness"" and ""Satellite Sun"".
DVDS_203_3	positive	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
DVDS_186_6	negative	I enjoy extras on DVD, this is so lacking.
MUSIC_102_3	neutral	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
DVDS_181_13	negative	Most painful is the cartoonish way the military is portrayed in this film.
ELECTRONICS_207_9	negative	This means that your equipment will get dusty even if the bag is closed.

1473	neutral	Israeli tactics put Shalit's issue at risk,

371	neutral	This bill is nothing more than an attempt for everybody to cover their butt up here on Capitol Hill,

422	negative	I called Mihai, I talked to him; he said that certainly, if the offer comes from the party leader, then he agrees. I talked to Mircea Geoana, and he said that he would contact him, in a first stage. I found out, after a week, talking to Mihai, that he had not been contacted by anyone,
346	neutral	We are the only city where Wall Street is just a subway stop away from Main Street. White-collar crime, as we have seen, affects our pensions, affects our not-for-profit institutions and it affects our businesses,
1089	neutral	We discussed this question especially as Mr Muallem came here with a high-ranking security official, which is confirmation of the will of the Syrians to solve this problem,

1519	neutral	I think that the case of our councilors is ripe to go even before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

307	neutral	I don't know that they've arrived at any final conclusions on which President Obama has signed off on, but their thinking is now very close to the conclusion of the process.
1341	negative	It's great for us. Outside his circle of fans, Limbaugh has become one of the most disliked people in the USA.
697	negative	The false idols of trickle down economics worshipped by Tories and New Labour alike have turned to dust. Constructing a new order, built on compassion, on social mobility, now falls to us. Resurrecting Britain's battered economy, this time with fairness at its foundations, now falls to us.

1284	neutral	ECOWAS is concerned about what has just happened in Guinea-Bissau,
340	positive	They are bailing out just about anybody that shows up and says they need cash. The public has grown weary of it and instead of throwing a banker to the wolves they have decided to throw Wagoner to the wolves,

469	neutral	If the process of integrating . . . members into the state security services and other institutions is frustrated, as it looks very much it will be, then this will leave a huge opportunity for Al Qaeda in Iraq, which has been down but never out, to get back into the game,

305	neutral	I believe that President Obama's message reflects exactly the message that Europeans have been trying to send to Iran.

588	neutral	However, let me be very clear on one point: the Eastern Partnership does not offer a membership prospective to these countries, but it is the recognition of our Eastern Partners intention to come closer to the European Union. With the different aspects of the Eastern Partnership we aim at fostering the economic and social development in these countries as well as at bringing these countries as close to the EU as is possible while fully respecting the political circumstances
1139	negative	additional pressure should be exerted, if needed, in order to force Hamas to reach a deal and become more flexible.
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,

1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,

1172	positive	John Buchanan is not Greg Chappell... the comparison is not fair. Dada is very dear to us and nobody is taking away the captaincy from him or taking him away from the team. John and Sourav are our mainstays and all decisions will be taken in tandem with them,
614	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,

803	neutral	His manner of communication points to his ignorance of the difference in jurisdiction between the Interior Ministry and the police,
482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov

607	neutral	The Western Balkans and Serbia's joining the European Union is a very important strategic point. Recognizing the independence of Kosovo and Metochy might create a precedent that, in its turn, may cause trouble for the future of our area,
1066	positive	This is very important. We are talking about the Airbus of the car industry. The Government cannot afford this brinkmanship. GM Europe has just a month of money left.
655	neutral	If we had taken the decision to allow LIAT to simply fold, the fact is that Caribbean Star... would have been subject to the decision of the US Supreme Court, there would have been a receiver, the assets would have been frozen... we would have had a real problem, a crisis, genuine crisis,

1064	negative	I supported the IRA during the conflict, I myself was a member of the IRA but that war is over,
694	neutral	I am of the view that it would be better if UPA contests in alliance. Even if it is only between the Congress and SP, it is good. Now we will decide our candidates in consultation with Mr. Singh.
871	neutral	You mustn't expect that this trip will change the position of the Catholic Church towards the problem of AIDS,
1198	neutral	In England, 89% of prescription items are dispensed for free, the remainder provide valuable income to the NHS, of £437 million in 2009/10, which goes towards to the safety and speed of healthcare.

488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission.

636	neutral	Our biggest problem at the moment is who is going to give us money. If the money is available who should it be given to, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Ministry of Finance? Should it be given to commercial banks or someone else?

337	neutral	no legal precedent supports the granting of the relief sought by the defendant Blagojevich in this motion.

The two men have exchanged a series of letters since Lugar first inquired on Feb. 5 about the losses. In them, Moreno sought to assure the senator that risk management procedures deemed deficient in an independent December audit are in fact in place and

1329	neutral	&gt;Shilpa Shetty has credited Jade Goody with giving her a high profile. The Bollywood actress famously became a household name in Britain amid a racism storm in 2007's Celebrity Big Brother. Thousands of viewers complained over the treatment of Shetty by the late Jade Goody and housemates Danielle Lloyd and Jo O' Meara. But the pair later patched up their differences and became friends.

408	neutral	Every day it becomes clearer that the Durban Review Conference is not about combating racism, but about promoting anti- Israel and anti-Semitic propaganda within the framework of the United Nations. The Obama administration and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deserve praise for sending a strong warning signal to the UN. Unfortunately, the efforts by the U.S. administration to ameliorate this process have not succeeded,

I have been following this programme closel

I want the debate to be in his office so that he can feel comfortable. I want all media to have access to the debate, not just one, and I don't see why he should pick a certain TV station and a certain day for the debate. BNT is not his own private TV station so that he could ask me to appear there. I see 11 TV cameras here and I am here with my econ
