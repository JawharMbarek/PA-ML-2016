107702559711571968	positive	comedy central is a good look tonight
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
222_ 2	negative	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
245_ 4	negative	audio on video also lacking .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
221_ 8	negative	the general button placement is not very user friendly .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
116_ 22	neutral	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :

194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .

146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
215_ 5	positive	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
107_ 1	positive	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
154_ 10	neutral	flat out
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !

226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .

217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .

217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
215_ 52	negative	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .

285_ 22	neutral	pros :

254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb

230_ 1	neutral	pros :
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
184_ 11	neutral	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
149_ 0	neutral	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
271_ 1	positive	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
166_ 12	neutral	likes
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
213_ 6	neutral	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
200_ 0	neutral	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
242_ 6	negative	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
226_ 16	negative	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
189_ 8	positive	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
252_ 3	positive	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
207_ 21	neutral	so now i keep it in my pocket .
232_ 1	neutral	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
287_ 8	neutral	most of our emplyees use this model phone .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
164_ 0	positive	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
123_ 3	neutral	this is not the same thing as a film camera .
170_ 39	neutral	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the "" now playing "" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
110_ 8	neutral	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
134_ 14	neutral	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
123_ 23	negative	canon 's g3 does it consistently .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
149_ 2	neutral	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
244_ 4	neutral	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
247_ 9	positive	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
224_ 31	neutral	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
224_ 23	negative	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
282_ 3	positive	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
155_ 9	neutral	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
285_ 6	positive	i like the size and weight of this little critter .
215_ 6	positive	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
305_ 14	positive	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
157_ 12	neutral	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
182_ 10	neutral	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
233_ 2	neutral	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
263_ 5	neutral	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
138_ 1	neutral	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
172_ 1	neutral	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
170_ 35	neutral	could not stop it , could not get out of the "" now playing "" screen .
199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
251_ 0	neutral	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
236_ 19	negative	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
185_ 10	positive	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
106_ 0	positive	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
119_ 20	neutral	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
269_ 5	negative	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
199_ 6	positive	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
209_ 4	positive	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
191_ 5	neutral	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
258_ 14	neutral	in manual , you can set it to "" single af "" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
309_ 7	positive	battery life is good for a phone of this size .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
104_ 7	positive	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
243_ 9	neutral	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
287_ 7	positive	the fm radio is cool .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
140_ 26	neutral	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
274_ 30	neutral	by what time standards -- martian ?
239_ 2	positive	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
132_ 4	positive	also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
182_ 1	positive	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
277_ 19	negative	i am bored with the silver look .
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
173_ 25	neutral	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
227_ 0	neutral	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
282_ 32	positive	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
170_ 32	neutral	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
224_ 48	neutral	none of these are perfect .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
266_ 3	positive	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
140_ 40	neutral	very easy to use .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
262_ 12	negative	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
249_ 13	positive	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
190_ 1	positive	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
134_ 26	positive	learning how to use it will not take very long .
139_ 5	positive	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
125_ 15	neutral	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
186_ 27	neutral	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
209_ 8	positive	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
127_ 1	neutral	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
218_ 3	neutral	good thing i got a replacement plan .
234_ 8	neutral	if it does , ill give up .
173_ 23	neutral	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
186_ 25	negative	fm receiver - it has none .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
187_ 3	neutral	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
158_ 0	neutral	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
292_ 3	positive	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
266_ 2	positive	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
308_ 4	neutral	print those coupons twice for two phones ?
251_ 3	neutral	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
170_ 43	neutral	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
115_ 23	neutral	sure .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
190_ 0	positive	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
301_ 11	positive	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
189_ 7	positive	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
130_ 3	neutral	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
189_ 12	positive	i would recommend this product to anyone .
211_ 1	positive	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
167_ 3	neutral	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
301_ 4	neutral	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
280_ 5	neutral	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
208_ 32	neutral	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
126_ 2	neutral	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
292_ 1	neutral	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
149_ 4	positive	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
170_ 13	neutral	now my dissapointments .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
163_ 0	neutral	awful , awful , awful .
215_ 49	neutral	pros summary :
191_ 13	neutral	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
209_ 1	positive	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
140_ 22	negative	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
216_ 0	neutral	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
129_ 0	neutral	this is my first digital camera .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
161_ 20	neutral	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
203_ 3	positive	* removable battery
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
203_ 9	neutral	does n't always register push-button movement .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
226_ 21	neutral	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
205_ 1	positive	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
231_ 18	neutral	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
285_ 0	neutral	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
220_ 24	neutral	so what are you waiting for ?
282_ 23	neutral	able to use service in another country :
108_ 4	neutral	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
219_ 4	negative	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
228_ 9	positive	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
115_ 6	negative	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
180_ 2	negative	the software failed repeatedly .
186_ 57	negative	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
109_ 14	neutral	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
294_ 7	neutral	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
290_ 6	neutral	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
290_ 19	neutral	battery :
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
123_ 19	neutral	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
282_ 34	positive	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
224_ 38	neutral	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
138_ 12	neutral	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
197_ 28	neutral	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
170_ 45	neutral	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
175_ 14	neutral	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
142_ 4	neutral	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
170_ 17	neutral	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
185_ 8	negative	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
208_ 34	neutral	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
152_ 4	neutral	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
284_ 1	neutral	great features . .
246_ 6	neutral	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
162_ 16	neutral	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
158_ 9	neutral	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
186_ 66	negative	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
238_ 7	neutral	it always pays off .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
166_ 9	negative	- included creative software is pretty poor .
155_ 19	neutral	it was impossible to do so before .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
121_ 3	neutral	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
221_ 11	neutral	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
171_ 0	positive	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
187_ 0	neutral	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
264_ 0	neutral	do n't let my five star rating fool you .
208_ 8	neutral	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
310_ 31	neutral	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
164_ 6	neutral	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
179_ 3	neutral	of course you do !
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
159_ 16	neutral	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
166_ 5	neutral	dislikes
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
231_ 15	positive	interface - practically seamless .
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
236_ 1	neutral	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
186_ 15	neutral	30gb is more than enough for most people .
179_ 1	negative	this thing is trash .
145_ 8	positive	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
186_ 4	neutral	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
144_ 9	neutral	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
186_ 20	negative	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
173_ 46	positive	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
262_ 20	neutral	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
274_ 44	neutral	so what 's the point ?
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
207_ 18	neutral	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
282_ 10	positive	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
116_ 25	neutral	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
186_ 62	neutral	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
302_ 11	neutral	but for now this will do .
208_ 21	negative	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
193_ 18	positive	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
192_ 6	negative	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
207_ 20	neutral	it happened to me once .
123_ 31	neutral	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
165_ 2	neutral	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
158_ 3	neutral	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
201_ 5	positive	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
125_ 2	positive	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
119_ 22	neutral	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
227_ 17	positive	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
208_ 0	negative	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
160_ 5	neutral	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
195_ 8	neutral	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
247_ 10	neutral	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of "" juice "" .
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
185_ 3	neutral	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
125_ 11	neutral	very cheaply made .
160_ 7	positive	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
209_ 0	neutral	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
158_ 14	neutral	i guess that 's why you so often see "" ipodders "" bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole "" i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better "" thing .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
309_ 10	neutral	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
131_ 0	neutral	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
186_ 19	neutral	cons :
173_ 47	neutral	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
238_ 3	neutral	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
198_ 2	neutral	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
236_ 3	neutral	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
265_ 3	positive	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
148_ 14	negative	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
162_ 18	neutral	we 'll see if i need them to .
261_ 1	positive	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
192_ 3	neutral	well i decided to get this one .
282_ 13	positive	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
181_ 5	positive	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
126_ 6	neutral	this camera performs like i can not believe !
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
274_ 2	neutral	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
170_ 22	negative	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
207_ 5	positive	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
126_ 1	neutral	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
189_ 10	neutral	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
170_ 41	neutral	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
207_ 23	neutral	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
173_ 32	neutral	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
123_ 18	neutral	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
258_ 17	positive	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
186_ 50	negative	controls are a bit awkward .
221_ 5	neutral	it was just a problem with the player .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
109_ 9	positive	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
285_ 31	neutral	cons :
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
213_ 3	neutral	boy was i wrong .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
143_ 0	positive	definetely a great camera .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
119_ 14	neutral	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
224_ 15	neutral	after that it seems like you 're on your own .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
213_ 14	neutral	now let 's talk about the software .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
215_ 48	neutral	resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
201_ 2	neutral	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
162_ 5	neutral	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
209_ 9	neutral	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
116_ 0	neutral	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
189_ 0	neutral	i purchased this player last week .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
275_ 4	positive	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
195_ 36	neutral	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
306_ 6	positive	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
125_ 4	neutral	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
281_ 2	negative	only con i can think of is no camera ... .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
134_ 22	neutral	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
300_ 20	neutral	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
193_ 19	positive	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
290_ 28	negative	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
287_ 3	positive	i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
229_ 10	negative	creative software stinks .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
248_ 1	neutral	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
231_ 19	neutral	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
138_ 11	neutral	i cancelled the order .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
189_ 5	negative	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
173_ 31	neutral	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
205_ 0	positive	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
172_ 2	positive	this thing seriously is a good player though .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
276_ 2	positive	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
224_ 10	neutral	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
309_ 5	neutral	i do n't really like bounce .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
249_ 11	neutral	very large pics take 8mb each !
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
306_ 3	neutral	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
262_ 7	negative	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
269_ 4	positive	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
140_ 9	neutral	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
262_ 6	positive	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
234_ 11	neutral	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
189_ 3	positive	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
170_ 42	neutral	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
222_ 17	neutral	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
231_ 0	positive	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
123_ 38	neutral	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
227_ 49	negative	you need the software to actually transfer files
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
204_ 0	neutral	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
200_ 20	neutral	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
178_ 0	positive	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
138_ 2	neutral	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
303_ 1	positive	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
135_ 1	neutral	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
194_ 8	neutral	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
158_ 2	neutral	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
173_ 59	neutral	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
110_ 10	positive	i highly recommend it .
309_ 21	neutral	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
300_ 12	neutral	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
246_ 17	neutral	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
191_ 10	neutral	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
174_ 1	neutral	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
206_ 13	neutral	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
246_ 13	negative	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
170_ 25	negative	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
259_ 2	neutral	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
313_ 0	neutral	i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
214_ 1	negative	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
270_ 11	positive	10 great price for all the features .
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
301_ 0	neutral	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
211_ 2	positive	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
173_ 53	negative	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
300_ 14	positive	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
305_ 9	neutral	i would not give up this phone for the world .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
222_ 11	negative	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
224_ 51	neutral	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
148_ 21	positive	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
309_ 14	negative	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
173_ 64	neutral	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
270_ 8	positive	7 picture quality is excellent .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
173_ 28	neutral	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
247_ 3	positive	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful "" scene "" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
179_ 6	negative	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
110_ 9	positive	it is a very amazing product .
208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
224_ 12	neutral	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
177_ 0	neutral	originally i wanted the ipod .
297_ 2	positive	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
281_ 1	positive	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone "" unlike the nokia 3650 "" and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
250_ 1	positive	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
309_ 1	neutral	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
259_ 0	positive	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
132_ 5	neutral	excellent idea !
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
131_ 2	neutral	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
112_ 0	neutral	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
253_ 1	neutral	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
140_ 8	positive	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
249_ 3	positive	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
108_ 2	neutral	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
165_ 12	positive	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
305_ 15	positive	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
275_ 3	neutral	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
166_ 7	negative	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
260_ 4	neutral	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
140_ 35	neutral	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
217_ 7	negative	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
225_ 9	neutral	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
227_ 36	neutral	10 .
221_ 3	negative	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
173_ 16	neutral	but who wants the wires involved .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
134_ 24	positive	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
235_ 4	neutral	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
195_ 4	neutral	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
146_ 5	positive	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
249_ 2	positive	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
178_ 3	positive	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
227_ 54	neutral	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
173_ 42	neutral	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
173_ 67	neutral	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
248_ 2	neutral	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
268_ 7	neutral	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
193_ 31	neutral	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
243_ 15	neutral	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
290_ 9	positive	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
183_ 5	positive	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
115_ 5	neutral	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
252_ 2	neutral	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
293_ 0	positive	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
242_ 7	neutral	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
217_ 9	negative	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .

208_ 4	positive	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .

249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .

298_ 8	positive	the battery life is amazing .

282_ 9	neutral	the radio :
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .

203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .

121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
136_ 0	positive	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
161_ 16	neutral	and go from there ... if you chose one of the "" all "" options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
217_ 13	negative	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
251_ 7	positive	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .

260_ 11	positive	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
166_ 4	negative	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
227_ 21	positive	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
177_ 2	neutral	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 "" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
288_ 1	neutral	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
134_ 29	neutral	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
224_ 11	neutral	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about "" white noise "" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
123_ 21	neutral	it focuses in a snap .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
145_ 5	neutral	that 's important because i have a lot of music .

193_ 28	neutral	oh ... one more thing .
182_ 12	positive	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
115_ 11	neutral	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
187_ 7	neutral	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
205_ 9	neutral	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
301_ 15	positive	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .

242_ 0	neutral	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
134_ 15	negative	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
207_ 1	neutral	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
193_ 32	neutral	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
273_ 6	positive	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
224_ 30	neutral	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
277_ 10	negative	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
134_ 10	negative	the included memory card is too small .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
186_ 63	negative	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .

200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
227_ 38	neutral	11 .

270_ 2	positive	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
156_ 1	neutral	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
310_ 21	neutral	their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
123_ 34	neutral	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
282_ 24	neutral	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
221_ 2	neutral	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
115_ 21	positive	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
195_ 39	positive	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
218_ 13	neutral	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
104_ 4	positive	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
236_ 29	neutral	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
256_ 5	negative	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
175_ 17	neutral	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .

231_ 21	negative	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
243_ 13	negative	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
116_ 17	positive	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
229_ 0	positive	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
246_ 1	positive	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
138_ 6	neutral	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
309_ 11	positive	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""

140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
105_ 6	positive	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
288_ 0	positive	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
116_ 38	positive	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
162_ 6	positive	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
310_ 17	neutral	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
218_ 11	neutral	i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
207_ 10	positive	you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
243_ 1	neutral	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
173_ 11	negative	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
140_ 38	neutral	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
246_ 9	neutral	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .

140_ 6	positive	the moveable lcd screen is great .
109_ 3	positive	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
167_ 6	neutral	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
170_ 21	negative	the interface used could be better designed .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .

285_ 4	positive	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .

193_ 1	neutral	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
254_ 3	neutral	i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
125_ 1	neutral	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .

122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
161_ 2	positive	way less expensive than the ipod .
195_ 35	neutral	you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
140_ 42	positive	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
154_ 3	positive	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
290_ 32	negative	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
182_ 8	positive	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
229_ 7	positive	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
136_ 5	neutral	my story is based on personal usage .
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
280_ 0	neutral	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
239_ 8	neutral	i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
249_ 8	positive	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
231_ 20	positive	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
184_ 7	positive	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
191_ 12	neutral	3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
224_ 7	neutral	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
161_ 11	neutral	if it had the same number of "" ? "" s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of "" ? "" s. . .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
161_ 25	neutral	hehe , my bad .
204_ 11	negative	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
207_ 4	neutral	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
173_ 15	neutral	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
244_ 1	neutral	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
260_ 7	neutral	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
184_ 5	positive	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
182_ 16	positive	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
173_ 60	neutral	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
224_ 47	neutral	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
145_ 7	neutral	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
301_ 9	negative	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
199_ 0	neutral	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
123_ 1	neutral	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
141_ 0	positive	i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
208_ 40	neutral	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
290_ 23	neutral	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
305_ 6	neutral	now i can always be in contact .
144_ 4	positive	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
203_ 5	negative	* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
300_ 1	positive	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
183_ 3	negative	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
142_ 1	positive	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
140_ 19	negative	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
168_ 1	neutral	plugged it in .
215_ 21	positive	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
243_ 0	neutral	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
148_ 13	negative	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
127_ 0	neutral	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
214_ 0	negative	i will never buy a creative product again .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
128_ 5	positive	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
231_ 5	neutral	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
125_ 12	negative	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
229_ 11	neutral	it 's horrible .
195_ 3	positive	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
115_ 12	negative	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
270_ 5	neutral	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
290_ 21	neutral	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
193_ 26	neutral	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
187_ 8	negative	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
106_ 1	positive	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
213_ 26	negative	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
215_ 39	neutral	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
249_ 5	positive	i love all of the features , and presets as well .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
204_ 7	neutral	solution ?
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
232_ 4	negative	do n't buy this player .
189_ 1	neutral	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
230_ 6	neutral	i did n't even try the included software .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
244_ 2	negative	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
116_ 14	neutral	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
215_ 12	positive	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
226_ 10	neutral	size and style :
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
162_ 13	negative	my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
176_ 3	neutral	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 14	negative	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
224_ 3	neutral	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
200_ 42	neutral	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
109_ 5	neutral	warning - i did read the manual !
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
220_ 23	negative	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
114_ 5	positive	great colors , pictures and white balance .
129_ 10	negative	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
117_ 2	neutral	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
268_ 10	positive	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
224_ 43	neutral	those that have it like it .
155_ 4	neutral	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
309_ 15	neutral	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
200_ 36	positive	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
282_ 37	positive	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
237_ 5	neutral	it worked good for a while .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
178_ 1	positive	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
215_ 32	neutral	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
282_ 28	positive	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
108_ 5	positive	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
183_ 6	neutral	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
124_ 2	positive	i love the quality of the pictures .
221_ 1	positive	my first impression was positive .
268_ 4	positive	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
240_ 1	neutral	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
123_ 39	negative	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
254_ 0	positive	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
310_ 10	neutral	you can also set a background wallpaper .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
116_ 12	negative	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
153_ 2	neutral	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
224_ 32	neutral	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
193_ 25	neutral	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
136_ 12	positive	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
155_ 21	positive	another plus in my book , no file limits !
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
220_ 16	negative	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
302_ 9	neutral	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
231_ 24	positive	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
140_ 34	neutral	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
252_ 0	positive	really happy with this little camera .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
140_ 41	neutral	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
182_ 7	positive	- uploading music is quick and easy .
243_ 7	negative	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
138_ 9	neutral	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
236_ 32	neutral	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
131_ 13	neutral	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
263_ 3	positive	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
116_ 1	neutral	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
200_ 2	neutral	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
309_ 13	positive	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
140_ 24	positive	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
262_ 17	neutral	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
150_ 4	negative	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
300_ 15	positive	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
311_ 6	neutral	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
114_ 2	positive	i love this camera .
265_ 8	neutral	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
222_ 7	neutral	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
295_ 0	neutral	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
215_ 42	neutral	recommendations :
140_ 27	neutral	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
186_ 43	neutral	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
273_ 2	neutral	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
227_ 35	positive	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
229_ 2	positive	price !
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
290_ 2	neutral	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
106_ 8	positive	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
173_ 56	neutral	software :
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
129_ 5	neutral	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
290_ 17	neutral	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
173_ 68	neutral	this is pretty cool .
161_ 26	neutral	that 's all for now .
265_ 0	neutral	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
179_ 2	neutral	want the laundry list of reasons why ?
171_ 1	neutral	first let me give you the bad things :
234_ 18	neutral	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
119_ 12	neutral	6 . the g2 's "" color effect "" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable "" effect func "" menu option available in all exposure modes .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
179_ 8	negative	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
262_ 8	neutral	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
240_ 0	neutral	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
287_ 5	positive	the phone is very light weight .
224_ 49	neutral	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
295_ 1	neutral	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
215_ 10	positive	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
265_ 11	neutral	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
309_ 3	neutral	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
116_ 11	neutral	now what about the flash problem ?
227_ 40	neutral	cons :
134_ 5	positive	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
149_ 8	neutral	just get some new headphones and your set .
148_ 8	neutral	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
254_ 1	positive	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
185_ 17	neutral	the reason it does not get 5 stars
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
248_ 0	neutral	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
258_ 8	neutral	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
222_ 12	negative	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
247_ 13	neutral	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an "" outlet environment "" .
155_ 22	neutral	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
258_ 1	positive	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
277_ 3	neutral	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
310_ 30	positive	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
163_ 3	neutral	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
173_ 7	positive	3 ) user replaceable battery
300_ 9	neutral	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
148_ 3	neutral	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
159_ 9	neutral	song transfers were not an issue .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
188_ 4	neutral	also the ipod has games on it .
134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
290_ 5	positive	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
224_ 25	negative	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
158_ 8	neutral	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
197_ 6	positive	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
165_ 0	positive	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
310_ 32	neutral	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
115_ 14	positive	the camera was a marvel .
150_ 11	positive	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
170_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift .
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
118_ 13	neutral	but who cares ?
116_ 9	positive	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
104_ 8	positive	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
198_ 3	negative	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
258_ 7	negative	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
226_ 8	positive	value : comparing data storage with price .
109_ 0	positive	this is a great camera for you !
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
213_ 28	neutral	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
208_ 17	neutral	is my unit defective ?
179_ 11	neutral	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
236_ 21	negative	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
182_ 24	neutral	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
204_ 1	positive	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
303_ 2	neutral	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
151_ 15	negative	overall , a very disappointing product .
292_ 6	positive	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
215_ 1	neutral	pros :
288_ 7	positive	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
105_ 9	positive	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
224_ 33	neutral	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
170_ 15	neutral	the warranty is 90 days .
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
177_ 1	neutral	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
264_ 2	positive	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
118_ 3	positive	the service from the supplier was exceptional .
123_ 10	neutral	picture this :
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
170_ 33	neutral	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
240_ 5	positive	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
250_ 4	neutral	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
290_ 4	neutral	the most important thing for me is sound quality .
234_ 9	neutral	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
311_ 1	positive	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
161_ 14	positive	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
175_ 12	negative	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
195_ 2	neutral	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
220_ 14	negative	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
161_ 3	neutral	my opinions :
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
121_ 5	neutral	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
310_ 23	neutral	now , for the t-mobile service :
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
258_ 6	neutral	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
185_ 13	positive	i am very pleased so far .
227_ 5	neutral	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
182_ 25	neutral	i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
123_ 6	neutral	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
167_ 4	negative	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
308_ 5	neutral	...
213_ 24	positive	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
203_ 7	neutral	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
300_ 16	neutral	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
277_ 17	neutral	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
278_ 4	positive	t-mobile was a pretty good server .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
148_ 4	neutral	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
290_ 12	neutral	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
119_ 1	positive	but canon never fails to amaze .
290_ 11	neutral	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .

116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
125_ 13	neutral	the g2 was better in this respect .
215_ 20	positive	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .

249_ 12	positive	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
273_ 0	neutral	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
307_ 6	negative	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
215_ 29	neutral	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .

123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
173_ 66	neutral	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .

230_ 5	neutral	neutral :
282_ 7	positive	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
222_ 4	neutral	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
249_ 6	positive	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
134_ 20	neutral	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
115_ 17	neutral	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
182_ 17	neutral	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
202_ 7	neutral	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
294_ 0	positive	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .

186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
209_ 6	neutral	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
182_ 14	positive	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
155_ 12	positive	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .

185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .

170_ 44	neutral	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
148_ 11	positive	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
195_ 15	neutral	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
238_ 4	negative	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
115_ 4	neutral	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .

117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
282_ 11	positive	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
164_ 7	negative	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
198_ 1	neutral	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
151_ 8	negative	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
141_ 1	neutral	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
298_ 12	neutral	i 've yet to be dissappointed .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
200_ 23	positive	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
200_ 30	neutral	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
274_ 45	positive	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
115_ 8	neutral	that meant even less light and just as much action .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
301_ 2	neutral	i have used this phone for two months now .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
131_ 16	neutral	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
243_ 2	negative	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
215_ 55	neutral	my favorite is to play "" any track "" - am rediscovering my music !

298_ 1	neutral	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
119_ 5	positive	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .

286_ 3	neutral	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
289_ 2	neutral	pros :
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
204_ 18	positive	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
294_ 2	positive	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
307_ 0	neutral	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
306_ 5	neutral	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
159_ 17	neutral	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
120_ 0	neutral	i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
308_ 2	neutral	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
146_ 10	neutral	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
274_ 35	neutral	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
202_ 8	neutral	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
268_ 9	positive	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
311_ 9	neutral	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
186_ 60	negative	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
234_ 6	neutral	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
123_ 30	neutral	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
274_ 29	neutral	24 hours ?
195_ 30	neutral	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
151_ 5	neutral	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
310_ 19	neutral	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
236_ 11	neutral	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
227_ 12	neutral	2 .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
157_ 13	neutral	a great buy .
276_ 3	positive	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
148_ 17	positive	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
166_ 10	neutral	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
188_ 0	positive	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
295_ 2	positive	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
274_ 39	neutral	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
285_ 26	positive	- outstanding signal reception
217_ 6	neutral	cons :
173_ 39	neutral	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
118_ 9	positive	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
159_ 1	neutral	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
306_ 10	neutral	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
289_ 1	neutral	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
215_ 25	negative	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
218_ 7	neutral	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
310_ 2	positive	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
274_ 1	negative	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
160_ 6	neutral	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
147_ 2	negative	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
144_ 6	neutral	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
208_ 37	neutral	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
247_ 11	neutral	i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
243_ 5	neutral	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .
186_ 23	neutral	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
104_ 12	negative	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
228_ 5	positive	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted .
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
162_ 3	neutral	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
224_ 44	neutral	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
185_ 9	positive	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
256_ 0	neutral	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
290_ 30	neutral	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
126_ 0	neutral	i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
153_ 8	neutral	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
227_ 43	neutral	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
194_ 14	neutral	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
154_ 6	neutral	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
179_ 7	negative	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
129_ 16	neutral	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
227_ 9	neutral	cons :
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
166_ 11	neutral	note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
117_ 9	neutral	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
189_ 9	positive	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
202_ 0	neutral	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
227_ 2	neutral	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
106_ 2	positive	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
290_ 0	neutral	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
157_ 5	neutral	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
122_ 1	neutral	why ?
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
204_ 16	positive	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
165_ 16	positive	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
191_ 2	neutral	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was "" the man "" and wo n't believe i returned it .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
186_ 58	neutral	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !
192_ 7	neutral	enjoy .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
214_ 4	neutral	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
228_ 15	positive	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
170_ 46	negative	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
274_ 12	neutral	i checked with nokia .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
186_ 18	neutral	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
118_ 5	positive	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
116_ 15	neutral	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
140_ 4	neutral	there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
183_ 2	negative	on my main computer the software did not work right .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
216_ 4	negative	nothing but hassle with this company .
209_ 5	positive	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
137_ 0	positive	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
140_ 7	neutral	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
155_ 27	neutral	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
235_ 1	negative	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
204_ 10	neutral	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
161_ 21	neutral	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
186_ 47	neutral	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
312_ 0	positive	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
175_ 18	neutral	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
204_ 4	neutral	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
215_ 40	neutral	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
197_ 20	neutral	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
115_ 20	neutral	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
109_ 8	positive	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
228_ 13	neutral	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
222_ 0	positive	overall , a good buy for the price .
302_ 14	positive	great features .. .
173_ 37	neutral	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
173_ 54	neutral	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
165_ 1	negative	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
285_ 21	neutral	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
226_ 15	neutral	con :
244_ 3	neutral	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
312_ 2	neutral	i did n't had any problem till now .
270_ 4	positive	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
288_ 6	neutral	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
111_ 3	positive	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
206_ 10	neutral	so i 'm screwed .
200_ 45	neutral	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
290_ 24	neutral	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
136_ 6	negative	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
186_ 12	neutral	this almost made it worth the price alone .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
184_ 13	neutral	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
177_ 9	neutral	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
237_ 2	negative	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
173_ 14	neutral	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
203_ 2	positive	* slick-looking design and improved interface
202_ 10	neutral	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
155_ 15	positive	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
290_ 25	neutral	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
148_ 15	neutral	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
162_ 21	positive	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
119_ 11	positive	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .

126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
213_ 4	neutral	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
186_ 64	negative	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .

213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
312_ 4	positive	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
109_ 7	neutral	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
310_ 29	neutral	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !

305_ 10	positive	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .

197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
243_ 10	negative	. lens cap is a really annoying
289_ 13	negative	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
127_ 15	neutral	highly recommended .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
158_ 13	neutral	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
222_ 1	positive	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
151_ 14	positive	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
210_ 12	negative	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
224_ 29	neutral	the zen has no stop button .
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
213_ 30	neutral	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
202_ 1	neutral	cheaper in every way .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
170_ 36	neutral	again had to remove the battery .
270_ 17	neutral	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
164_ 3	neutral	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
221_ 7	negative	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
129_ 6	neutral	it is not perfect though .
288_ 12	positive	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
236_ 26	neutral	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
246_ 18	neutral	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
226_ 7	neutral	2 .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
282_ 16	positive	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
266_ 0	positive	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
134_ 23	neutral	good points :
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
254_ 2	neutral	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
173_ 57	positive	i 've had no problems with the software .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
127_ 6	positive	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
140_ 36	neutral	if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
138_ 4	neutral	one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , "" actually we do n't ship on saturdays "" .
307_ 5	neutral	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
127_ 3	positive	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
187_ 9	negative	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
210_ 11	neutral	not good if you 're taking this traveling .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
312_ 6	neutral	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
224_ 18	neutral	construction quality is a difficult item .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
150_ 9	neutral	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
276_ 1	positive	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
138_ 7	neutral	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
300_ 19	neutral	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
285_ 30	positive	- very long-lasting battery life
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
140_ 18	neutral	negatives ?
111_ 6	positive	overall it is the best camera on the market .
187_ 15	neutral	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
252_ 7	positive	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
140_ 21	negative	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
240_ 2	positive	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
292_ 4	neutral	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
225_ 2	positive	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
290_ 27	negative	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
208_ 2	positive	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
243_ 14	positive	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
134_ 8	neutral	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
151_ 7	negative	the player itself has all sorts of problems .
137_ 2	negative	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
263_ 1	positive	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
116_ 31	neutral	i didnt wait to experiment .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
285_ 17	negative	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
204_ 2	positive	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
192_ 5	positive	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
173_ 45	positive	the price compared to the ipod is great .
287_ 4	positive	i like the automatic key lock function .
215_ 33	neutral	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
246_ 21	neutral	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
185_ 11	positive	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
265_ 1	neutral	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
208_ 51	positive	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
246_ 4	neutral	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
213_ 10	neutral	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
279_ 2	negative	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
186_ 8	neutral	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
231_ 26	positive	it was no problem for me to use their software .
173_ 40	neutral	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
167_ 5	negative	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
120_ 3	negative	got way too many blurry pictures .
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
260_ 5	neutral	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
193_ 23	positive	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
113_ 0	neutral	i just bought the camera a few days ago .
104_ 9	neutral	negatives
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
133_ 1	positive	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
140_ 11	neutral	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
277_ 1	positive	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
200_ 18	neutral	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
161_ 9	negative	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
114_ 7	neutral	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
306_ 4	positive	it has a classic design yet looks hip .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
208_ 20	neutral	i have n't figured it out yet .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
208_ 52	neutral	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
213_ 5	neutral	that 's been my experience .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
236_ 2	neutral	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
231_ 9	positive	the screen 's large and easily read .
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
215_ 54	positive	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
214_ 2	neutral	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
267_ 0	neutral	had it for a week .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
208_ 9	neutral	i do n't think so .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
229_ 5	positive	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
200_ 16	neutral	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
209_ 12	neutral	minor gripe .
124_ 3	positive	they look fantastic .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
116_ 32	neutral	instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
246_ 5	neutral	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
129_ 2	neutral	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
186_ 16	positive	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
227_ 47	negative	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
155_ 26	neutral	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
262_ 15	neutral	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
222_ 14	neutral	cons :
192_ 4	positive	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
197_ 26	neutral	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
171_ 7	positive	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
134_ 19	negative	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
147_ 6	positive	so far the software for the pc works easily .
110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
202_ 9	negative	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
278_ 6	negative	they are not wowable good .
184_ 17	neutral	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
310_ 3	positive	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
285_ 1	neutral	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
236_ 34	neutral	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
246_ 2	neutral	here were my requirements in a digital camera :
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
231_ 17	positive	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
144_ 8	neutral	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
195_ 17	neutral	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
311_ 3	neutral	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a "" worldphone "" and can be used in europe , etc.
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
173_ 55	neutral	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
154_ 1	neutral	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
228_ 14	neutral	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
303_ 0	neutral	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
289_ 15	neutral	please !
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
145_ 6	positive	the software is great .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
173_ 62	positive	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
118_ 7	neutral	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
225_ 5	negative	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
265_ 13	neutral	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
305_ 0	positive	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
165_ 9	neutral	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
239_ 6	positive	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
274_ 47	neutral	guess all that glitters is not gold .
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
262_ 1	neutral	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
107_ 0	positive	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
195_ 25	neutral	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
148_ 1	neutral	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
104_ 6	neutral	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
270_ 9	positive	8 battery life is excellent .
138_ 8	neutral	they said it is in stock , but they are "" too busy "" .
211_ 4	positive	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
264_ 5	positive	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
207_ 8	positive	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
155_ 2	neutral	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
270_ 13	negative	1 no direct firewire to the camera .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
294_ 1	positive	the features are really cool like the radio .
282_ 2	neutral	the speakerphone :
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
162_ 23	neutral	yes .
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
195_ 9	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
175_ 2	neutral	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
210_ 8	negative	- the software that came with it was tough to load .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
280_ 9	negative	poor visibility on the keys .
193_ 24	negative	but the earbuds suck !
116_ 29	neutral	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
162_ 27	neutral	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
119_ 16	neutral	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
305_ 11	positive	yes , the features are numerous .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
152_ 2	neutral	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
275_ 1	neutral	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
200_ 10	neutral	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
257_ 3	positive	the quality is superb .
118_ 11	negative	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
251_ 4	negative	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
262_ 5	neutral	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
246_ 3	neutral	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 "" or 5x7 "" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 "" photos once in a while .
175_ 13	neutral	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
186_ 21	neutral	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
150_ 2	positive	i had no problems following their installation instructions .
200_ 37	negative	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
244_ 0	negative	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
173_ 29	neutral	updating the unit 's firmware :
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
224_ 17	negative	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
217_ 8	neutral	i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
262_ 16	positive	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
151_ 0	neutral	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
121_ 17	neutral	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
159_ 0	neutral	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
115_ 10	negative	the grain was terrible .
307_ 2	neutral	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
182_ 11	positive	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
187_ 2	neutral	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
285_ 18	positive	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
150_ 0	neutral	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
193_ 14	negative	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
123_ 22	neutral	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
196_ 0	neutral	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
221_ 14	neutral	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
227_ 46	neutral	2 .
203_ 11	neutral	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
297_ 5	neutral	really quiet .
115_ 9	neutral	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
279_ 1	neutral	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
290_ 3	neutral	sound quality :
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
171_ 8	positive	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
302_ 1	negative	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
191_ 24	negative	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . ""
237_ 7	neutral	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
253_ 4	positive	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
251_ 2	positive	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
270_ 20	neutral	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
274_ 48	neutral	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
141_ 3	neutral	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
224_ 37	neutral	- you just have to buy a new player .
206_ 4	neutral	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
232_ 3	neutral	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
210_ 6	positive	+ screen was good , easy to read
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
197_ 0	neutral	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
268_ 6	neutral	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
153_ 1	neutral	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
186_ 37	neutral	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
285_ 13	negative	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
180_ 7	neutral	do n't buy this thing .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
131_ 6	neutral	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
173_ 26	neutral	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
195_ 31	negative	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
310_ 24	neutral	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
149_ 7	positive	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
231_ 10	negative	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
128_ 0	neutral	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
140_ 37	neutral	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
170_ 38	negative	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
217_ 11	negative	the software sucks .
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
118_ 4	neutral	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
208_ 29	negative	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
208_ 50	neutral	if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
185_ 15	neutral	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
203_ 12	negative	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
145_ 3	positive	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
301_ 1	neutral	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
311_ 4	neutral	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
123_ 7	neutral	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
249_ 0	neutral	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
220_ 22	negative	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
310_ 6	positive	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
285_ 28	positive	- bright , visible screen
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
224_ 46	neutral	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
195_ 23	neutral	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
229_ 9	neutral	cons .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
213_ 7	neutral	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
274_ 0	negative	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
254_ 5	positive	just point and shoot and the photos were great .
226_ 12	positive	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
173_ 33	neutral	storage :
274_ 31	negative	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
309_ 0	neutral	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
269_ 1	positive	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
285_ 7	positive	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
116_ 7	neutral	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
123_ 37	neutral	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
105_ 5	positive	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
144_ 3	positive	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
129_ 13	negative	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
208_ 23	neutral	many reviewers refer to it as "" clunky "" or "" difficult "" - heed their warnings .
105_ 0	positive	the camera has a wonderful set of features .
178_ 6	neutral	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
116_ 16	neutral	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
165_ 11	positive	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
300_ 17	neutral	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
173_ 35	neutral	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
176_ 4	neutral	zens rule .
118_ 8	positive	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
118_ 15	positive	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
221_ 13	neutral	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
