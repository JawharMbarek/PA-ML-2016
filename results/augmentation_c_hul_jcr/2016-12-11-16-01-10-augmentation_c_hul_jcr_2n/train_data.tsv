174_ 4	neutral	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled "" on "" button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
254_ 10	positive	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
148_ 0	neutral	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
231_ 29	positive	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
136_ 14	neutral	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
273_ 8	positive	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
302_ 7	neutral	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
224_ 24	negative	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
191_ 16	neutral	the bottom line :
116_ 4	neutral	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
108_ 1	neutral	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
187_ 4	positive	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
191_ 11	neutral	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
141_ 5	positive	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
242_ 12	neutral	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
165_ 10	positive	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
256_ 8	neutral	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
162_ 11	neutral	i just put it on "" shuffle "" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
186_ 0	neutral	summary :
264_ 1	neutral	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
260_ 2	positive	i particularly like the "" txt "" file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
245_ 2	negative	also , the lens cap design is flawed .
115_ 24	neutral	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
277_ 2	neutral	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
262_ 22	neutral	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
151_ 10	negative	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
226_ 5	neutral	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
159_ 14	positive	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
238_ 0	neutral	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
195_ 26	negative	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
156_ 3	negative	also , the instruction manual is very bad .
165_ 7	neutral	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
114_ 3	neutral	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
271_ 3	positive	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
122_ 1	neutral	why ?
270_ 6	neutral	5 for "" digital film "" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
282_ 36	positive	overall , i highly recommend this phone .
166_ 13	positive	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
290_ 39	neutral	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
262_ 23	neutral	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
118_ 12	neutral	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
256_ 2	positive	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
111_ 5	neutral	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
229_ 4	neutral	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
256_ 3	positive	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
185_ 2	neutral	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
215_ 35	neutral	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
220_ 19	neutral	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
197_ 22	positive	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
157_ 9	neutral	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
119_ 9	neutral	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
224_ 13	neutral	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
280_ 8	negative	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
215_ 22	positive	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
311_ 2	negative	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
188_ 2	neutral	the reason for this the ipod has "" a better user interface "" .
273_ 9	neutral	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
309_ 6	neutral	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
245_ 3	neutral	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
227_ 14	neutral	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
229_ 8	positive	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
282_ 22	neutral	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
236_ 30	neutral	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
218_ 10	negative	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
164_ 17	negative	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
283_ 2	positive	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
305_ 17	neutral	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
145_ 14	positive	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
163_ 4	neutral	bummer as it has great sound quality .
132_ 7	neutral	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
220_ 2	neutral	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
195_ 37	neutral	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
139_ 7	neutral	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
285_ 14	negative	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
138_ 13	neutral	thanks for nothing , amazon !
252_ 4	positive	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
241_ 2	neutral	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
301_ 8	neutral	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
274_ 38	neutral	umm , well , thanks for nothing .
239_ 1	positive	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
173_ 44	neutral	price :
109_ 6	positive	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
164_ 4	neutral	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
128_ 1	neutral	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
283_ 8	negative	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
116_ 24	neutral	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
148_ 12	negative	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
213_ 12	neutral	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
208_ 31	negative	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
274_ 22	neutral	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
274_ 32	neutral	also , they 'd forgotten to add "" wap "" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
178_ 2	neutral	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
258_ 4	neutral	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
278_ 7	neutral	you have to buy better ones .
301_ 10	negative	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
180_ 0	neutral	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
281_ 3	neutral	no big deal for the size . .
220_ 8	positive	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
258_ 18	neutral	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
267_ 1	positive	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
309_ 9	positive	great screen and great sound .
170_ 10	neutral	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
140_ 12	neutral	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
123_ 20	neutral	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
136_ 19	positive	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
209_ 10	negative	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
208_ 39	neutral	i followed their advice but that failed , too .
226_ 4	positive	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
173_ 4	neutral	pros :
270_ 16	neutral	this does n't affect the picture , of course .
155_ 6	neutral	i will just say this :
215_ 19	neutral	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
236_ 33	neutral	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
186_ 61	negative	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
158_ 5	neutral	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
285_ 9	negative	the fact that the "" 0 "" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the "" # "" key instead .
231_ 11	positive	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
306_ 11	neutral	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
186_ 9	neutral	this would have been much easier .
116_ 35	neutral	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
217_ 2	neutral	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
116_ 28	negative	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
162_ 12	negative	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
215_ 36	positive	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
127_ 10	positive	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
123_ 33	neutral	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
126_ 8	neutral	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
109_ 13	positive	the more i work with it , the more i love it !
170_ 7	positive	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
199_ 5	neutral	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
300_ 3	positive	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
224_ 35	neutral	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
252_ 6	neutral	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
162_ 0	positive	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
200_ 46	neutral	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
234_ 13	neutral	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
153_ 3	positive	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
220_ 4	neutral	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
140_ 33	positive	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
151_ 9	negative	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
282_ 1	positive	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
274_ 21	positive	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
185_ 6	neutral	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
197_ 11	positive	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
304_ 0	positive	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
164_ 15	neutral	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
302_ 12	neutral	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
228_ 7	neutral	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
213_ 11	neutral	so now i 've got to call their customer "" service "" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
173_ 22	positive	overall i like it .
200_ 3	neutral	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
277_ 0	neutral	i have had this phone for about 5 months .
277_ 13	neutral	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
203_ 15	negative	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
310_ 28	positive	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
159_ 10	neutral	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
155_ 16	positive	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
289_ 3	positive	small size .
227_ 19	positive	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
194_ 9	neutral	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
274_ 40	neutral	that was annoying .
173_ 69	neutral	sound :
194_ 16	neutral	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
290_ 15	neutral	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
306_ 7	neutral	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
208_ 5	neutral	flaws :
262_ 21	neutral	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
166_ 2	positive	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
262_ 10	neutral	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
215_ 24	negative	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
195_ 10	negative	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
300_ 8	positive	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
191_ 9	neutral	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
289_ 0	neutral	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
215_ 8	positive	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
270_ 1	neutral	these are the reasons i think it 's great :
281_ 0	neutral	the title says it all ...
234_ 4	neutral	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
173_ 9	negative	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
159_ 13	neutral	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
195_ 32	negative	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
224_ 19	neutral	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
149_ 5	positive	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
109_ 4	positive	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
303_ 4	neutral	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
195_ 13	neutral	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
227_ 25	neutral	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
146_ 0	neutral	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
158_ 12	positive	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
239_ 0	positive	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
312_ 7	negative	when talking the voice is not very clear .
310_ 16	positive	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
224_ 40	neutral	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
171_ 5	positive	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
175_ 4	positive	for the price and features it is really good .
162_ 4	positive	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
173_ 63	positive	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
226_ 6	neutral	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
305_ 4	neutral	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
260_ 8	neutral	one thing puzzles me is that for "" fine and 2200 + "" quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
207_ 22	negative	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
202_ 6	neutral	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
136_ 18	neutral	it 's a winner .
280_ 7	positive	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
231_ 28	neutral	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
194_ 17	neutral	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
200_ 7	neutral	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
107_ 5	neutral	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
131_ 8	neutral	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
262_ 18	neutral	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
306_ 2	neutral	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
260_ 10	neutral	anybody can explain that ?
250_ 3	positive	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
161_ 7	neutral	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
190_ 8	positive	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
126_ 5	neutral	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
151_ 16	negative	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
215_ 43	neutral	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
126_ 4	neutral	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
268_ 3	positive	but this camera is great !
215_ 47	neutral	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
156_ 2	neutral	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
228_ 2	neutral	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
264_ 4	positive	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
226_ 17	neutral	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
119_ 8	neutral	a big plus in my book .
239_ 5	positive	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
195_ 14	neutral	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
105_ 3	positive	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
167_ 8	neutral	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
213_ 22	negative	it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n't a clue why .
186_ 32	neutral	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
247_ 14	positive	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
206_ 5	neutral	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
131_ 7	neutral	a great new use for that underutilized computer .
280_ 10	neutral	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
216_ 5	neutral	what kind of product goes out within a month ?
124_ 5	neutral	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
256_ 6	neutral	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
157_ 10	positive	the lcd screen was very large and readable .
302_ 2	neutral	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
228_ 1	positive	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
248_ 10	neutral	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
236_ 27	neutral	you will have a very expensive paperweight .
155_ 28	positive	i really have no complaints over this unit .
285_ 29	positive	- speakerphone
228_ 6	neutral	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
200_ 9	neutral	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
197_ 14	neutral	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
170_ 20	negative	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
206_ 6	neutral	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
177_ 6	positive	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
249_ 4	negative	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
125_ 6	neutral	i agree with the positive reviews .
161_ 13	neutral	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
240_ 6	positive	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
119_ 2	neutral	some of the great gains over g2 --
173_ 50	neutral	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
175_ 16	neutral	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
282_ 25	neutral	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
173_ 30	neutral	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
215_ 26	neutral	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
229_ 2	positive	price !
134_ 12	negative	it is made of plastic .
122_ 2	positive	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
116_ 10	neutral	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
121_ 2	neutral	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
155_ 7	neutral	i will never go back to my archos again ! !

290_ 19	neutral	battery :
113_ 4	neutral	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
207_ 14	positive	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
142_ 5	positive	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
140_ 17	neutral	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
202_ 2	negative	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
300_ 7	positive	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
297_ 6	neutral	grandma in church quiet .
119_ 19	neutral	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
236_ 6	neutral	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
138_ 0	neutral	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
164_ 5	neutral	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
171_ 6	positive	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
126_ 11	neutral	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .

110_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
289_ 16	neutral	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
186_ 51	neutral	the controls definately took some getting used to .
118_ 6	neutral	recently , i attended a "" flyball "" competition
134_ 7	neutral	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
116_ 26	neutral	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
152_ 1	positive	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
145_ 10	negative	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
134_ 11	neutral	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
271_ 0	neutral	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
121_ 11	neutral	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
119_ 10	positive	the light auto-correction is awesome .
144_ 1	positive	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
282_ 26	neutral	size and weight :
129_ 1	positive	i am very pleased with it so far .
193_ 20	neutral	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
236_ 5	negative	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
238_ 6	neutral	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
162_ 1	positive	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
158_ 11	neutral	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
129_ 3	neutral	this seemed like a really good compromise .
277_ 16	positive	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
182_ 9	neutral	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
266_ 7	neutral	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
248_ 8	neutral	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
195_ 0	neutral	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
197_ 30	neutral	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
227_ 8	neutral	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
306_ 8	positive	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
212_ 1	negative	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
256_ 4	positive	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
283_ 3	positive	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
120_ 4	neutral	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
305_ 16	positive	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
203_ 1	positive	* price and capacity
178_ 5	neutral	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
140_ 20	neutral	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
186_ 71	neutral	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
309_ 4	negative	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
224_ 20	negative	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
164_ 21	neutral	highly recommended !
227_ 10	neutral	1 .
136_ 11	positive	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
265_ 17	neutral	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
148_ 9	neutral	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
226_ 13	neutral	4 .
177_ 4	neutral	so what ?
164_ 9	neutral	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
283_ 6	neutral	cons :
302_ 5	neutral	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .

173_ 48	neutral	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
170_ 6	positive	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
186_ 17	neutral	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
195_ 40	neutral	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
206_ 0	neutral	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
195_ 6	neutral	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
171_ 3	negative	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
224_ 27	negative	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
131_ 14	neutral	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
121_ 18	neutral	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
284_ 2	negative	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
113_ 2	positive	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
231_ 25	positive	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
116_ 36	negative	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
290_ 1	neutral	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
223_ 1	neutral	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is "" sold out "" or more likely "" discontinued "" at the almighty amazon.com ?
201_ 4	neutral	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
155_ 13	positive	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
133_ 0	positive	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
150_ 7	negative	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
186_ 2	neutral	pros :
213_ 2	neutral	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
254_ 6	neutral	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
215_ 9	positive	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
205_ 5	neutral	this is a powerful piece of equipment .
287_ 1	positive	i like the speakphone function a lot .
191_ 21	negative	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
190_ 5	positive	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
218_ 14	negative	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
285_ 19	neutral	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
222_ 5	neutral	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
121_ 7	neutral	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
170_ 26	neutral	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
175_ 19	neutral	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
285_ 34	negative	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
220_ 17	neutral	not a big hassle as many would have you think .
159_ 4	neutral	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
162_ 25	neutral	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
242_ 5	positive	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
105_ 4	positive	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
213_ 18	negative	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
118_ 14	neutral	i always shoot using the lcd panel .
246_ 15	negative	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
159_ 2	negative	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
304_ 2	negative	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
121_ 20	neutral	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
266_ 4	positive	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
208_ 1	neutral	zen good points :
145_ 0	neutral	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
273_ 4	positive	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
194_ 6	neutral	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
277_ 6	neutral	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
224_ 28	positive	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
182_ 20	negative	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
277_ 14	neutral	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
155_ 17	positive	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
195_ 22	neutral	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
137_ 1	positive	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
155_ 30	neutral	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
177_ 3	positive	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
302_ 3	neutral	almost there .
110_ 7	neutral	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
220_ 18	negative	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . ""
225_ 0	positive	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
129_ 11	neutral	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
136_ 16	neutral	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
290_ 16	neutral	that is a very nice feature .
305_ 1	positive	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
117_ 4	neutral	whoa .
298_ 4	positive	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
288_ 3	positive	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
175_ 11	negative	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
168_ 7	positive	i love it ! !
197_ 16	positive	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
194_ 1	neutral	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
215_ 38	neutral	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
104_ 2	positive	excellent range of metering options as well .
203_ 20	neutral	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
186_ 5	positive	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
123_ 0	negative	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
136_ 8	neutral	the distortion is not a flaw .
313_ 1	positive	it is crystal clear .
168_ 5	neutral	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
121_ 19	neutral	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
228_ 8	positive	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
208_ 54	neutral	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
118_ 0	neutral	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
114_ 4	positive	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
159_ 11	neutral	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
226_ 23	neutral	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
230_ 0	positive	have had the player since xmass and love it !
119_ 6	neutral	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
149_ 1	neutral	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
289_ 11	neutral	cons :
242_ 3	neutral	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
290_ 40	neutral	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
143_ 1	positive	proven canon built quality and lens .
303_ 7	neutral	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
286_ 2	neutral	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
274_ 11	negative	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
161_ 18	neutral	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
179_ 5	negative	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
278_ 8	negative	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
173_ 10	negative	2 ) scroll button / switch
209_ 13	neutral	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
152_ 3	neutral	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
116_ 39	positive	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
282_ 15	negative	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
182_ 22	neutral	conclusion :
195_ 19	neutral	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
156_ 0	negative	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
144_ 0	neutral	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
206_ 9	neutral	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
246_ 11	positive	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
227_ 26	neutral	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
307_ 1	neutral	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
199_ 1	neutral	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
129_ 20	positive	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
280_ 4	neutral	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
186_ 42	negative	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
139_ 4	positive	everything else about the camera is great .
150_ 10	positive	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
150_ 13	positive	this is a good deal for music and data storage .
200_ 26	neutral	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
218_ 9	negative	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
242_ 4	neutral	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
269_ 6	negative	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
176_ 1	negative	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
161_ 15	neutral	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
303_ 8	positive	great phone , i 'd buy another .
312_ 3	positive	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
186_ 24	neutral	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
227_ 50	neutral	4 .
155_ 5	neutral	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
157_ 2	positive	then sorting the files is easy as pie .
200_ 15	neutral	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
173_ 6	positive	2 ) storage capacity
210_ 13	negative	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
195_ 34	neutral	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
273_ 1	positive	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
173_ 58	positive	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
139_ 0	negative	this camera has a major design flaw .
105_ 1	positive	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
289_ 6	positive	color screen is good .
153_ 5	neutral	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .

182_ 23	positive	this player is an ideal purchase .
237_ 0	neutral	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
215_ 53	neutral	bottom-line :
187_ 13	neutral	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
277_ 18	neutral	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
203_ 10	negative	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
202_ 5	neutral	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
280_ 2	neutral	it defaulted to unchangeable email .
249_ 15	neutral	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
252_ 5	neutral	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
140_ 25	neutral	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
142_ 6	negative	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
154_ 5	positive	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
285_ 25	positive	- well-backlit keypad
227_ 3	neutral	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
270_ 3	positive	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
186_ 45	neutral	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the "" notmad explorer , "" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
306_ 0	positive	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
214_ 3	neutral	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
203_ 18	neutral	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
191_ 14	neutral	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
206_ 12	neutral	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
207_ 6	positive	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
224_ 50	neutral	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
155_ 24	positive	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
282_ 8	negative	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
170_ 18	neutral	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
234_ 15	positive	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
251_ 1	positive	it has many great features and very few bad ones .
105_ 2	neutral	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
297_ 4	negative	its quiet .
220_ 10	positive	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
273_ 5	neutral	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
194_ 3	neutral	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
282_ 20	positive	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
257_ 1	neutral	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
169_ 1	negative	this product is too fragile for normal use .
129_ 4	neutral	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
116_ 33	positive	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
305_ 5	positive	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
248_ 3	neutral	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
191_ 20	negative	my only significant complaint is sound quality .
170_ 12	neutral	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
262_ 11	neutral	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
174_ 3	neutral	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
300_ 5	positive	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
230_ 2	positive	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
234_ 7	neutral	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
175_ 6	neutral	sure enough there is no such ability .
285_ 23	positive	- light , compact design
280_ 3	neutral	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
230_ 7	neutral	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
195_ 18	neutral	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
189_ 4	positive	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
170_ 4	negative	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
262_ 0	neutral	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
257_ 0	positive	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
282_ 33	positive	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
259_ 3	neutral	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
195_ 7	positive	the storage capacity is great for me --
210_ 15	neutral	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
250_ 2	neutral	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
161_ 10	neutral	and since the current language selection was english ( even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were "" ? "" s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
240_ 3	positive	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
274_ 6	neutral	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
300_ 0	neutral	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
294_ 8	neutral	thanks !
148_ 20	neutral	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
195_ 29	neutral	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
278_ 5	neutral	it has 2 games .
282_ 17	neutral	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
248_ 4	negative	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
109_ 2	neutral	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
182_ 4	positive	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
121_ 13	neutral	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
140_ 39	neutral	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
158_ 4	neutral	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8 "" ) .
238_ 5	neutral	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
132_ 3	positive	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
231_ 8	positive	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
154_ 7	neutral	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
173_ 17	neutral	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
185_ 18	negative	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
106_ 5	neutral	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
262_ 19	neutral	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
264_ 7	neutral	buy this camera and savour it .
157_ 3	positive	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
129_ 17	positive	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
180_ 1	neutral	what a disappointment .
203_ 17	negative	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
114_ 1	neutral	got a great deal from a reputable seller .
276_ 4	neutral	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
140_ 2	neutral	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
136_ 15	neutral	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
203_ 14	negative	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
123_ 2	neutral	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
207_ 13	positive	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
215_ 30	negative	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
285_ 32	negative	- some features in the user interface
263_ 4	positive	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
274_ 15	neutral	more downside to this phone ?
254_ 7	positive	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
162_ 8	positive	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
301_ 17	positive	nokia does not disappoint in this model .
185_ 16	positive	very simple to use .
191_ 7	neutral	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
309_ 8	positive	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
274_ 28	negative	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
220_ 9	positive	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
237_ 1	neutral	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
186_ 13	neutral	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
186_ 39	neutral	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
157_ 4	positive	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
293_ 1	positive	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
234_ 0	neutral	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
125_ 14	negative	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
218_ 5	neutral	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
252_ 1	positive	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
221_ 4	neutral	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
200_ 44	neutral	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
186_ 40	negative	software - the software is crap .
173_ 24	neutral	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
236_ 14	neutral	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
228_ 0	positive	and also , it 's priced very affordably .
265_ 15	neutral	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
186_ 53	neutral	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
142_ 0	neutral	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
131_ 15	neutral	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
130_ 1	positive	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
136_ 22	neutral	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
313_ 2	positive	this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
205_ 7	positive	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
204_ 14	positive	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
134_ 27	positive	the image quality is excellent .
130_ 0	positive	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
227_ 16	neutral	3 .
147_ 7	positive	by the way , it looks nice also .
304_ 4	positive	the service from t-mobile is very good too .
164_ 8	negative	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
164_ 16	positive	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
278_ 0	positive	it has a nice color screen .
204_ 8	neutral	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
251_ 6	positive	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
227_ 18	neutral	4 .
290_ 29	neutral	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
197_ 23	positive	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
132_ 2	positive	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
191_ 6	neutral	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
181_ 4	positive	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
186_ 52	negative	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
215_ 7	positive	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
173_ 38	neutral	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
203_ 6	neutral	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
242_ 2	neutral	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
159_ 12	neutral	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
239_ 9	positive	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
227_ 23	neutral	6 .
277_ 8	negative	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
107_ 6	neutral	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
207_ 17	neutral	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
207_ 24	neutral	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
191_ 27	neutral	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
213_ 0	neutral	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
140_ 29	neutral	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
136_ 7	neutral	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
236_ 31	neutral	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
292_ 0	neutral	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
194_ 4	neutral	now we come to the zen xtra .. .
200_ 32	neutral	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
200_ 39	negative	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
208_ 38	neutral	creative provided e-mail support ;
200_ 27	neutral	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
215_ 51	neutral	cons summary :
224_ 41	neutral	the karma does have a stop button .
164_ 13	positive	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
146_ 2	neutral	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
306_ 12	neutral	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
117_ 6	neutral	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
186_ 31	negative	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
186_ 56	negative	crappy headphones .
306_ 9	neutral	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
127_ 14	positive	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
113_ 5	negative	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
218_ 12	neutral	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
175_ 0	neutral	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
186_ 6	neutral	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
161_ 22	neutral	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
213_ 9	negative	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
258_ 13	neutral	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
203_ 16	negative	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
222_ 13	positive	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
150_ 6	positive	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
121_ 0	neutral	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
148_ 5	positive	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
201_ 1	neutral	it is a beast .
195_ 5	positive	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
116_ 23	neutral	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
270_ 14	neutral	there is usb , though .
243_ 11	neutral	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
119_ 21	positive	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
184_ 15	neutral	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
173_ 71	negative	i was a little disappointed in the low end .
121_ 6	neutral	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
139_ 2	neutral	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
220_ 20	neutral	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
140_ 3	positive	and so far , i 've been very pleased .
227_ 48	neutral	3 .
180_ 5	negative	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
146_ 7	neutral	cons :
140_ 1	neutral	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
164_ 11	negative	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
170_ 27	negative	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
274_ 8	neutral	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
294_ 3	positive	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
210_ 3	neutral	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
239_ 7	positive	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
193_ 15	neutral	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
289_ 4	positive	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
125_ 0	positive	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
134_ 0	neutral	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
227_ 31	neutral	9 .
258_ 5	negative	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
220_ 0	neutral	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
192_ 2	neutral	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
204_ 17	negative	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
173_ 2	negative	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
186_ 68	negative	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
215_ 27	negative	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
200_ 31	neutral	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
310_ 1	neutral	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
115_ 1	negative	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
115_ 19	neutral	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
274_ 10	neutral	however , it serves its purpose .
116_ 34	positive	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
106_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
153_ 0	positive	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
197_ 18	neutral	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
226_ 1	neutral	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
170_ 19	negative	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
224_ 6	neutral	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
229_ 3	neutral	almost half what an ipod would cost you !
188_ 1	neutral	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
187_ 11	neutral	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
282_ 30	positive	the battery life on this phone is surreal .
231_ 27	neutral	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
287_ 2	neutral	it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
104_ 11	negative	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
201_ 3	positive	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
282_ 12	neutral	tri-band :
234_ 14	neutral	you know why ?
290_ 35	positive	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
171_ 4	neutral	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
266_ 5	positive	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
162_ 14	neutral	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
263_ 0	positive	great camera .
302_ 0	neutral	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
242_ 10	neutral	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
246_ 16	neutral	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
225_ 6	neutral	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
123_ 9	neutral	i am not talking milliseconds .
219_ 2	negative	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
274_ 33	positive	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
203_ 0	neutral	pros :
187_ 6	negative	but the major problem i had was with the software .
229_ 6	negative	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
291_ 0	positive	this is the best phone i have seen .
193_ 12	positive	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
258_ 10	neutral	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
265_ 2	positive	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
260_ 9	neutral	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
299_ 1	negative	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
200_ 6	neutral	tiny !
195_ 16	negative	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
227_ 34	positive	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
108_ 6	positive	the prints are beautiful !
182_ 19	positive	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
148_ 2	positive	it 's worth it .
188_ 5	neutral	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
242_ 1	neutral	reason for two ?
106_ 9	neutral	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
116_ 27	negative	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
301_ 16	neutral	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
283_ 1	neutral	pros :
129_ 19	positive	i am quite happy with the camera .
210_ 5	positive	+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
266_ 1	positive	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
239_ 4	positive	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
160_ 3	positive	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
298_ 5	positive	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
182_ 15	positive	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
227_ 20	neutral	5 .
249_ 16	positive	great camera , great investment !
220_ 6	positive	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
151_ 6	neutral	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
186_ 33	neutral	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
130_ 2	neutral	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
265_ 10	neutral	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
110_ 5	neutral	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
288_ 5	positive	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
240_ 7	neutral	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
228_ 10	positive	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
269_ 7	neutral	a card with more memory is a must .
107_ 2	positive	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
261_ 0	positive	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
279_ 0	neutral	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
208_ 10	neutral	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
208_ 25	neutral	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
197_ 13	neutral	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
151_ 3	neutral	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
208_ 49	neutral	conclusion :
157_ 1	positive	getting files onto it is quick and painless .
247_ 1	neutral	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
186_ 59	negative	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
218_ 6	neutral	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
123_ 4	neutral	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
119_ 13	neutral	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
164_ 20	neutral	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
193_ 6	positive	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
200_ 13	neutral	just be aware of it .
191_ 17	neutral	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
136_ 20	neutral	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
236_ 22	neutral	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
265_ 14	positive	the "" scene "" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a "" regular "" setting .
170_ 16	negative	this is ridiculous .
165_ 8	positive	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
185_ 19	negative	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
282_ 5	positive	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
173_ 20	neutral	do n't drop this unit :
116_ 13	positive	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
277_ 4	neutral	signal strength will affect the battery life .
184_ 14	positive	lastly , the price is fantastic :
177_ 8	neutral	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
262_ 24	neutral	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
186_ 7	neutral	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
134_ 9	neutral	negative points :
162_ 2	neutral	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
289_ 5	neutral	just make sure the keys are locked .
173_ 65	neutral	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
289_ 10	positive	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
290_ 13	neutral	ease of use :
227_ 52	negative	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
277_ 5	neutral	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
305_ 7	positive	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
189_ 6	positive	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
220_ 21	neutral	take the time to fill in those tags !
194_ 7	negative	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
162_ 29	neutral	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
166_ 15	positive	- large easy readable screen
201_ 0	neutral	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
270_ 22	neutral	most of these "" annoyances "" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
119_ 24	positive	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
269_ 3	positive	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
172_ 0	neutral	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
301_ 12	negative	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
215_ 44	neutral	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
224_ 4	neutral	ipod clearly has the most buzz .
231_ 2	neutral	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
215_ 28	neutral	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
139_ 3	neutral	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
262_ 9	negative	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
274_ 16	negative	the volume .
203_ 19	neutral	final verdict :
134_ 31	neutral	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
215_ 34	negative	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
224_ 26	negative	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
134_ 25	positive	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
227_ 28	positive	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
155_ 25	neutral	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
153_ 10	neutral	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
309_ 12	positive	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
205_ 2	positive	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
168_ 0	neutral	charged my battery .
160_ 2	negative	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
249_ 7	positive	the software you get with this camera is perfect .
186_ 69	neutral	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
111_ 0	positive	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
264_ 3	neutral	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
294_ 4	neutral	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
161_ 12	neutral	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
302_ 10	neutral	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
236_ 4	positive	the sound quality is very good .
157_ 11	neutral	thank you !
195_ 24	neutral	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
272_ 1	positive	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
123_ 25	neutral	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
144_ 2	positive	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
173_ 61	neutral	through the software you can classify songs in genres .
208_ 28	neutral	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
115_ 18	neutral	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
123_ 11	neutral	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
168_ 4	neutral	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
221_ 0	neutral	i received this as a gift for christmas .
136_ 4	neutral	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
223_ 2	neutral	hmmmmm ....
197_ 19	neutral	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
285_ 35	negative	- no propietary headset jack
282_ 19	positive	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
144_ 5	neutral	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
146_ 8	negative	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
127_ 4	neutral	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
184_ 4	positive	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
161_ 5	positive	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
305_ 13	neutral	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
143_ 2	positive	feels solid in hand .
228_ 16	neutral	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
227_ 22	neutral	you can also search for your song , which is good .
212_ 4	negative	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
179_ 10	neutral	so .. .
127_ 2	positive	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
219_ 1	negative	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
185_ 21	positive	all in all suprisingly easy to use .
298_ 0	neutral	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
119_ 7	positive	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
152_ 6	positive	other than that this thing is great ...
184_ 9	positive	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
153_ 9	neutral	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
240_ 4	positive	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
247_ 4	positive	the movie mode is also working great .
131_ 10	positive	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
215_ 18	positive	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
151_ 1	negative	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
131_ 12	neutral	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
239_ 3	positive	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
248_ 9	neutral	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
121_ 16	positive	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
208_ 3	neutral	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
257_ 4	positive	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
116_ 18	neutral	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
246_ 19	neutral	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
203_ 13	negative	* software is absolutely terrible :
123_ 13	neutral	splash !
197_ 31	neutral	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
115_ 3	neutral	i do n't think i was asking too much .
208_ 55	neutral	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
228_ 17	neutral	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
223_ 0	neutral	what 's going on creative labs ?
261_ 2	positive	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
236_ 12	negative	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
153_ 4	negative	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
134_ 32	neutral	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
206_ 8	neutral	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
249_ 10	neutral	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
110_ 6	neutral	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
145_ 2	positive	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
282_ 4	positive	as said before this works perfectly .
197_ 12	negative	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
274_ 17	neutral	oh my goodness --
213_ 15	negative	like other reviewers , installation was hell .
290_ 22	neutral	features :
140_ 16	positive	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
262_ 25	neutral	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
298_ 11	positive	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
200_ 17	neutral	that 's the first thing to understand .
285_ 10	neutral	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
145_ 13	neutral	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
220_ 5	neutral	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
268_ 5	neutral	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
197_ 32	neutral	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
222_ 10	neutral	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
159_ 7	negative	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
305_ 12	positive	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
106_ 7	neutral	anyone looking for more than "" point and shoot "" can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
274_ 9	negative	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
155_ 10	positive	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
197_ 17	neutral	player controls :
159_ 15	neutral	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
269_ 2	positive	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
134_ 17	negative	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
189_ 11	positive	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
193_ 30	negative	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
242_ 11	neutral	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
127_ 9	neutral	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
283_ 5	positive	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
211_ 6	neutral	i cannot recommend it enough ! !
243_ 6	neutral	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
241_ 4	neutral	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
229_ 13	negative	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
193_ 8	neutral	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
243_ 3	neutral	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
131_ 9	neutral	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
231_ 16	neutral	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
289_ 14	negative	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
187_ 10	negative	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
208_ 43	neutral	third party software to the rescue
311_ 8	neutral	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
173_ 18	neutral	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
105_ 7	negative	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
195_ 33	neutral	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
155_ 20	positive	 ^
185_ 20	negative	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
274_ 34	neutral	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a "" yes "" answer from you .
151_ 2	neutral	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
131_ 1	positive	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
225_ 8	neutral	wow .
200_ 38	neutral	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
305_ 2	neutral	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
260_ 3	positive	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
215_ 50	positive	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
119_ 23	neutral	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
247_ 2	neutral	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
154_ 8	positive	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
283_ 9	negative	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
124_ 1	neutral	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
231_ 6	positive	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
226_ 3	neutral	pro : 1 .
117_ 3	positive	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
220_ 1	positive	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
161_ 8	negative	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
302_ 6	neutral	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
235_ 2	neutral	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
263_ 6	neutral	now where did i put that manual ?
136_ 13	neutral	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
176_ 2	neutral	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
173_ 3	neutral	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
250_ 0	neutral	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
213_ 16	neutral	subsequent behavior even worse .
125_ 9	neutral	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display "" lens "" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
200_ 5	neutral	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
265_ 4	negative	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
186_ 14	positive	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
197_ 1	neutral	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
272_ 2	positive	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
221_ 10	negative	third , the poor design continues with the case .
177_ 5	neutral	i can do that myself .
197_ 4	positive	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
111_ 2	positive	night mode is clear as day .
231_ 13	neutral	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
165_ 6	positive	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
182_ 13	neutral	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
134_ 30	positive	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
144_ 7	neutral	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
207_ 16	positive	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
122_ 0	positive	the powershot g3 is a great camera .
107_ 3	neutral	absolutely breathtaking .
260_ 6	neutral	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into "" out of battery "" situation .
163_ 2	negative	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
213_ 25	neutral	but that 's a moot point now .
104_ 5	positive	3 ) 4x zoom is nice
310_ 11	positive	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
178_ 8	neutral	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
125_ 8	negative	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
174_ 0	neutral	wow , dennis sure is great !
200_ 4	neutral	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
173_ 12	neutral	features that would have been nice :
207_ 15	positive	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
236_ 10	neutral	and then it breaks .
208_ 46	neutral	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
285_ 8	negative	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
163_ 1	negative	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
276_ 0	neutral	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
228_ 11	positive	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
165_ 15	positive	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
213_ 29	neutral	be forewarned .
197_ 21	neutral	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
277_ 7	neutral	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
289_ 12	neutral	not many .
227_ 24	positive	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
255_ 0	positive	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
125_ 5	neutral	many before me have done that already .
220_ 11	neutral	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
180_ 6	neutral	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
220_ 13	positive	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
194_ 5	positive	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
294_ 6	neutral	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
174_ 5	neutral	there was very little light in there .
203_ 4	neutral	cons :
155_ 14	positive	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
193_ 0	neutral	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
116_ 8	neutral	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
173_ 21	neutral	i 've had the player for about a month now .
218_ 1	negative	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
218_ 0	neutral	i was prepared to love it .
179_ 12	neutral	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
311_ 0	positive	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
215_ 45	neutral	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
200_ 1	neutral	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
178_ 7	neutral	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
196_ 1	neutral	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
285_ 16	negative	the vibrate setting is loud !
298_ 6	positive	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
136_ 1	neutral	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
258_ 19	positive	they take excellent macro shots as well .
277_ 9	negative	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
225_ 10	neutral	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
195_ 28	neutral	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
207_ 12	neutral	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
134_ 13	neutral	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
150_ 8	neutral	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
310_ 14	positive	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
227_ 33	positive	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
304_ 7	positive	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
108_ 3	neutral	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
180_ 4	negative	creative labs customer support website is useless .
294_ 5	neutral	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
136_ 10	neutral	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
222_ 6	neutral	no difference .
226_ 18	negative	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
191_ 26	neutral	one minor complaint :
141_ 4	neutral	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to "" get into "" it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
221_ 9	neutral	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
226_ 9	neutral	3 .
213_ 27	neutral	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
232_ 2	negative	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . ""
231_ 14	neutral	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
186_ 3	positive	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
175_ 7	neutral	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
162_ 22	neutral	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
127_ 16	neutral	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
208_ 27	negative	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
193_ 7	neutral	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
270_ 10	positive	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
134_ 28	neutral	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
247_ 6	neutral	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on "" normal "" resolution .
224_ 14	neutral	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
262_ 3	positive	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
142_ 7	positive	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
275_ 2	neutral	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
193_ 17	positive	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
116_ 5	positive	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
128_ 4	positive	the g3 looks like a work of art !
241_ 5	positive	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
262_ 2	neutral	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
131_ 3	neutral	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
282_ 27	positive	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
170_ 9	positive	i love the storage in this thing .
126_ 10	positive	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
236_ 20	negative	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
170_ 2	negative	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
161_ 24	neutral	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
254_ 12	neutral	before they are sold out !
207_ 9	neutral	point the "" media sniffer "" to your music files and let it do the rest .
182_ 18	positive	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
200_ 25	negative	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
277_ 12	neutral	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
195_ 11	neutral	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
116_ 30	neutral	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
145_ 1	neutral	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
310_ 15	neutral	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
138_ 5	neutral	so why lie about it ?
195_ 12	neutral	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
304_ 5	neutral	in all a winning combination .
185_ 7	positive	usb 2.0 - very fast
198_ 0	positive	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
159_ 6	negative	size - bigger than the ipod
116_ 20	neutral	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
164_ 19	positive	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
290_ 38	neutral	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
210_ 7	positive	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
247_ 8	positive	even at the "" normal "" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a "" digital "" .
229_ 12	neutral	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
191_ 1	positive	it is an extremely cool gizmo .
185_ 14	neutral	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
285_ 3	positive	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
205_ 6	neutral	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
280_ 1	negative	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
116_ 21	neutral	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
238_ 8	neutral	hope i 've been of some help .
298_ 9	positive	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
125_ 3	positive	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
208_ 45	neutral	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
262_ 13	neutral	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
134_ 3	positive	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
173_ 72	neutral	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
307_ 9	neutral	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
300_ 4	neutral	on an average , you would charge it once a week .
213_ 21	negative	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
128_ 2	positive	because this camera is beautiful .
201_ 6	positive	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
234_ 12	neutral	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
161_ 0	negative	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
146_ 3	neutral	pros :
111_ 4	negative	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
161_ 6	neutral	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
197_ 25	neutral	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
286_ 0	neutral	this bumpy is wicked groovy .
227_ 45	neutral	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
234_ 1	positive	honestly , i love this player .
180_ 3	neutral	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
208_ 16	neutral	is eax faulty ?
127_ 13	neutral	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
219_ 0	positive	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
258_ 3	neutral	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
288_ 10	negative	only if we could get one camera in it . .
310_ 0	positive	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
312_ 9	neutral	go for it ...
193_ 11	neutral	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
184_ 16	neutral	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
195_ 21	neutral	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
225_ 11	neutral	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
132_ 6	negative	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
191_ 4	neutral	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
125_ 7	neutral	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
308_ 5	neutral	...
206_ 1	neutral	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
173_ 1	positive	overall i like the unit .
181_ 3	positive	otherwise , this player is awesome !
123_ 35	neutral	so buy the g3 .
298_ 10	positive	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
123_ 5	neutral	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
215_ 11	positive	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
158_ 7	neutral	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
200_ 11	neutral	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
123_ 32	neutral	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
173_ 51	negative	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
290_ 18	neutral	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
311_ 5	negative	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
162_ 15	positive	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
170_ 5	neutral	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
181_ 6	positive	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
191_ 25	neutral	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
129_ 18	neutral	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
274_ 7	neutral	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
143_ 3	neutral	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
146_ 11	neutral	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
283_ 7	negative	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
186_ 70	positive	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
237_ 4	neutral	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
177_ 10	neutral	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
134_ 2	neutral	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
157_ 8	positive	the battery is nice .
297_ 8	neutral	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
290_ 7	positive	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
200_ 33	neutral	the pros and cons of it :
142_ 3	neutral	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
166_ 8	negative	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
236_ 28	neutral	there are not a lot of good options out there .
135_ 2	positive	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
208_ 36	neutral	it referred to a "" microsoft jet database engine "" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
165_ 5	positive	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
280_ 6	neutral	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
286_ 1	neutral	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
248_ 5	neutral	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
160_ 1	neutral	its great .
119_ 15	neutral	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
289_ 9	positive	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
245_ 1	negative	made the camera totally inoperable .
222_ 9	neutral	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
208_ 35	negative	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
115_ 2	negative	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
115_ 16	neutral	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
123_ 14	neutral	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
164_ 18	neutral	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
208_ 18	neutral	was i just unlucky at that moment ?
207_ 7	neutral	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
235_ 3	neutral	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
234_ 5	negative	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
205_ 8	positive	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
227_ 11	positive	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
200_ 14	neutral	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
162_ 26	positive	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
136_ 9	neutral	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
116_ 37	neutral	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
153_ 11	neutral	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
226_ 0	positive	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
187_ 5	positive	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
200_ 41	positive	i 'm really happy with this purchase .
274_ 25	neutral	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
187_ 14	neutral	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
107_ 4	neutral	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
284_ 0	positive	nice little phone ... light compact . .
224_ 34	neutral	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
179_ 0	neutral	wow .. .
224_ 9	neutral	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
208_ 26	negative	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
282_ 35	negative	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
197_ 24	positive	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
158_ 1	neutral	you 're talking totally different hardware .
161_ 1	neutral	the pro ...
197_ 7	positive	second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
259_ 1	positive	the picturers are amazing .
225_ 1	negative	but with a low price , comes lower quality .
144_ 10	neutral	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
110_ 3	positive	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
118_ 2	neutral	i 'm very glad i did .
256_ 1	positive	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
150_ 1	positive	it 's a very intuitive program .
106_ 6	positive	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
310_ 20	negative	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
211_ 3	positive	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
168_ 3	neutral	started ripping and transferring .
121_ 8	neutral	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
159_ 5	negative	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
108_ 0	neutral	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
119_ 3	positive	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
309_ 16	negative	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
114_ 6	positive	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
119_ 18	neutral	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
186_ 65	neutral	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
265_ 7	neutral	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
236_ 9	neutral	they fall in love with the product .
249_ 14	neutral	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
264_ 6	neutral	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
186_ 22	neutral	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
140_ 15	positive	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
157_ 6	neutral	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
253_ 3	positive	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
175_ 5	neutral	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
207_ 3	positive	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
106_ 4	neutral	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
200_ 43	neutral	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
246_ 10	neutral	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
228_ 3	neutral	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
170_ 3	negative	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
262_ 4	positive	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
167_ 0	neutral	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
173_ 19	neutral	details :
287_ 6	positive	the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
117_ 8	neutral	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
193_ 27	neutral	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
210_ 10	negative	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
289_ 7	positive	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
307_ 3	neutral	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
123_ 17	neutral	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
265_ 6	positive	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
309_ 18	positive	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
120_ 1	neutral	big mistake .
258_ 20	positive	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
200_ 47	negative	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
296_ 0	neutral	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
236_ 35	neutral	you will be sorry if you do .
242_ 9	neutral	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
231_ 31	positive	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
222_ 16	neutral	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
210_ 9	neutral	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
313_ 3	neutral	i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
260_ 0	neutral	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
122_ 3	positive	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
170_ 8	positive	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
215_ 23	neutral	cons :
278_ 1	positive	it is small .
212_ 0	neutral	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
210_ 16	negative	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
243_ 8	negative	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .
226_ 22	neutral	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and "" explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player "" to replace the mediasource .
275_ 5	positive	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
173_ 36	neutral	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
208_ 7	negative	mediasource did not recognize my tags !
136_ 17	neutral	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
193_ 5	neutral	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
165_ 4	neutral	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
213_ 20	neutral	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
173_ 5	positive	1 ) price / gb of storage
173_ 70	positive	the sound from the player is ok .
209_ 11	neutral	whereas some folks have the "" ipod "" , i have the "" nomad jukebox zen xtra "" ( not to be confused with the "" nomad jukebox zen nx "" ) .
116_ 19	neutral	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
308_ 1	neutral	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
184_ 10	positive	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
288_ 8	positive	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
191_ 0	neutral	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
281_ 4	positive	this phone is a winner ...
183_ 1	positive	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
231_ 3	neutral	look / design :
221_ 12	neutral	it also covers over the power jack when closed .
236_ 7	neutral	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
208_ 19	neutral	was it a full moon that night ?
193_ 2	neutral	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
127_ 7	neutral	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
105_ 8	positive	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
285_ 20	negative	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
151_ 4	negative	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
204_ 5	neutral	this is possible ! !
186_ 35	negative	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
186_ 44	negative	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
197_ 15	neutral	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
186_ 11	positive	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
253_ 0	positive	this is a wonderful camera .
150_ 3	positive	the menus are very easy to navigate .
129_ 15	neutral	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
151_ 18	negative	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
213_ 13	negative	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
200_ 12	neutral	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
257_ 2	positive	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
126_ 3	neutral	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
148_ 18	neutral	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
208_ 41	neutral	so it is probably "" just bad luck "" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
119_ 4	positive	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
147_ 3	positive	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
222_ 3	negative	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
236_ 24	neutral	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
110_ 4	positive	four megapixels is great .
227_ 44	neutral	5 hours max. i did it like this
210_ 0	negative	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
191_ 22	neutral	this did not give me enough control .
190_ 6	positive	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
170_ 37	neutral	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
129_ 21	positive	yes , i recommend it over the competition .
215_ 4	positive	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
162_ 7	positive	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
288_ 9	positive	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
290_ 14	neutral	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
161_ 17	neutral	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
173_ 8	neutral	cons :
236_ 25	neutral	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
190_ 2	positive	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
170_ 1	positive	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
184_ 0	positive	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
247_ 12	neutral	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
185_ 12	positive	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
236_ 17	neutral	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
140_ 13	positive	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
152_ 7	neutral	enjoy !
220_ 15	neutral	that is , if a folder on your computer called "" mp3 "" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
215_ 56	positive	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
193_ 34	neutral	hope i helped !
111_ 7	neutral	i give it 10 stars !
224_ 39	neutral	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
307_ 8	positive	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
224_ 45	neutral	otherwise feedback seems to be good .
300_ 11	neutral	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
122_ 4	positive	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
222_ 15	negative	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
119_ 0	neutral	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
123_ 12	neutral	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
234_ 3	neutral	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
210_ 2	positive	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
274_ 26	negative	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
116_ 3	neutral	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
231_ 7	positive	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
182_ 2	positive	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
310_ 22	neutral	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
285_ 12	positive	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
122_ 5	neutral	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
224_ 5	neutral	great design and looks cool .
278_ 2	neutral	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
217_ 12	neutral	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
272_ 0	positive	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
207_ 19	negative	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
227_ 15	neutral	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
118_ 10	neutral	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
241_ 0	neutral	i love photography .
274_ 20	positive	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
246_ 8	neutral	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
215_ 0	neutral	carry your entire collection !
175_ 8	negative	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
170_ 29	positive	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
200_ 34	positive	great price .
170_ 34	neutral	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
212_ 6	neutral	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
224_ 0	neutral	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
166_ 1	positive	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
121_ 1	neutral	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
191_ 23	neutral	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
175_ 15	neutral	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
116_ 2	neutral	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
299_ 0	neutral	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
273_ 3	negative	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
274_ 27	negative	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work "" in 24 hours "" .
184_ 8	negative	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
208_ 56	neutral	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
274_ 43	neutral	and no t-zones .
241_ 3	positive	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
191_ 15	negative	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
301_ 6	positive	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
217_ 10	negative	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
182_ 21	positive	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
160_ 4	positive	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
175_ 1	neutral	it was not my first choice .
312_ 5	negative	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
225_ 3	negative	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
234_ 16	neutral	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
129_ 8	neutral	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
219_ 3	neutral	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
226_ 14	positive	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
226_ 15	neutral	con :
155_ 23	positive	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
193_ 21	positive	its really cool .
248_ 6	neutral	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
126_ 7	positive	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
303_ 5	positive	i have had no problems with the phone .
270_ 12	neutral	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
283_ 0	neutral	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
185_ 1	neutral	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
126_ 12	neutral	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
132_ 1	neutral	you can always spend more money to get a better one .
147_ 5	neutral	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
194_ 10	negative	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
181_ 2	negative	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
310_ 27	neutral	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
302_ 13	positive	great phone .. .
227_ 53	neutral	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
197_ 9	neutral	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
159_ 3	negative	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
311_ 7	neutral	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
204_ 3	positive	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
132_ 8	positive	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
123_ 29	neutral	they stop time .
194_ 12	negative	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
200_ 40	neutral	for me , that was the only drawback .
274_ 3	positive	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of "" plastic-like "" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
195_ 38	neutral	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
292_ 5	positive	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
210_ 1	neutral	in a quick summation , here is what i found .
145_ 12	positive	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
224_ 42	neutral	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
215_ 37	neutral	experience :
195_ 1	neutral	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
121_ 12	neutral	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
170_ 30	negative	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
162_ 20	neutral	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
290_ 33	neutral	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
204_ 6	neutral	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the "" duplicate name "" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
128_ 3	neutral	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
189_ 2	neutral	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
182_ 6	neutral	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
121_ 15	neutral	the canon g3 .
179_ 4	negative	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
191_ 18	neutral	sure it 's "" old school "" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
117_ 0	positive	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
207_ 2	neutral	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
226_ 20	neutral	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
302_ 4	neutral	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
238_ 2	neutral	the batteries would not charge .

208_ 47	positive	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
310_ 5	negative	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

208_ 33	negative	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
227_ 37	positive	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
177_ 7	neutral	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
170_ 23	neutral	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
164_ 10	neutral	that 's probably a bad thing .
186_ 49	negative	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
149_ 6	positive	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
162_ 19	negative	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
309_ 17	neutral	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )

134_ 1	positive	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
260_ 1	positive	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
166_ 3	positive	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
249_ 1	neutral	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .

154_ 4	positive	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
202_ 3	negative	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
138_ 10	neutral	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
140_ 0	neutral	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
270_ 0	neutral	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
233_ 3	negative	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
167_ 1	neutral	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .

115_ 15	neutral	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .

301_ 18	neutral	go for it !
125_ 10	neutral	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .

215_ 13	positive	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
118_ 1	neutral	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
206_ 14	positive	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .

134_ 33	neutral	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
206_ 11	neutral	but you do n't have to be .
193_ 10	negative	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
120_ 2	negative	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
258_ 15	neutral	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
306_ 14	positive	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .

310_ 25	neutral	if you have a question , they have the answer .

170_ 11	neutral	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .

304_ 6	neutral	worth every penny !
131_ 11	neutral	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
224_ 1	neutral	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
301_ 5	positive	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
146_ 4	positive	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
256_ 7	positive	battery life is ok .
167_ 2	neutral	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of "" please register with us so we can spam your inbox "" .
191_ 19	neutral	one major complaint :
140_ 28	neutral	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !

166_ 12	neutral	likes
290_ 10	neutral	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .

199_ 3	negative	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
215_ 15	positive	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
115_ 7	neutral	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
303_ 6	neutral	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
173_ 75	neutral	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
232_ 0	negative	do n't buy this player .
185_ 5	neutral	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
227_ 4	neutral	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
199_ 2	positive	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
117_ 5	positive	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
313_ 4	neutral	there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .

154_ 10	neutral	flat out
162_ 24	neutral	get better headphones .
225_ 4	neutral	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
213_ 23	neutral	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
218_ 4	neutral	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
145_ 9	positive	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
305_ 8	neutral	a great deal in general !
215_ 31	negative	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
246_ 22	neutral	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
127_ 12	neutral	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
148_ 22	positive	( batteries last longer too ! )
109_ 11	positive	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
123_ 16	neutral	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
222_ 8	negative	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
108_ 7	neutral	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
194_ 13	negative	the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
166_ 14	positive	- best in class sound
300_ 13	positive	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
211_ 0	neutral	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
224_ 2	neutral	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
213_ 1	positive	the price / performance looked just right .
231_ 12	neutral	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
186_ 29	negative	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
164_ 2	neutral	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
278_ 3	neutral	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
268_ 2	neutral	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
227_ 29	neutral	8 .
205_ 4	negative	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
164_ 1	neutral	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
191_ 3	neutral	so what 's the problem ?
274_ 49	neutral	hope someone else has better luck !
243_ 12	neutral	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately "" fine **"" picture quality  "" image size : 1600 .
203_ 8	negative	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
274_ 37	neutral	"" i 'm not sure "" . ) .
286_ 5	neutral	word ... peace in the east bruvah .
271_ 4	positive	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
205_ 3	positive	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
215_ 41	neutral	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
170_ 40	neutral	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
193_ 16	positive	it 's easy .
109_ 15	positive	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
197_ 29	neutral	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
227_ 6	neutral	now getting back to this .
192_ 0	neutral	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
236_ 15	neutral	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
150_ 12	positive	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
227_ 27	neutral	7 .
245_ 5	positive	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
204_ 15	neutral	no complaints there .
186_ 1	positive	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
193_ 4	neutral	anyway , on with the review .
162_ 10	positive	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
181_ 1	negative	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
129_ 7	neutral	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
186_ 28	negative	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
204_ 13	neutral	how does it sound ?
123_ 27	neutral	what task do they perform ?
153_ 7	neutral	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
310_ 7	positive	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
245_ 0	negative	got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase .
285_ 22	neutral	pros :
301_ 13	neutral	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
305_ 3	neutral	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
224_ 36	neutral	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
215_ 2	positive	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
265_ 16	positive	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
162_ 9	positive	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
224_ 52	neutral	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
227_ 39	positive	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
124_ 0	positive	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
275_ 0	neutral	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
146_ 6	neutral	no issues as of yet
204_ 12	neutral	weird .
190_ 7	positive	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
282_ 21	neutral	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
246_ 14	negative	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
173_ 73	neutral	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
184_ 6	positive	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
168_ 6	positive	working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! !
208_ 30	neutral	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the "" next track "" or "" previous track "" button .
258_ 11	neutral	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
134_ 18	negative	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
268_ 8	positive	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
208_ 53	neutral	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
310_ 13	neutral	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
185_ 4	positive	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
171_ 2	negative	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
168_ 2	neutral	installed software .
206_ 3	neutral	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
210_ 4	neutral	it may have taken several years to fill this up .
166_ 6	negative	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
234_ 17	neutral	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
246_ 7	neutral	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
216_ 3	neutral	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
212_ 3	neutral	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
258_ 2	neutral	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
113_ 1	neutral	before i "" get used to it "" , here are my first feelings :
170_ 14	neutral	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
208_ 42	neutral	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
186_ 38	neutral	you have to add all the songs to a play list .
274_ 41	positive	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
178_ 4	positive	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
123_ 28	neutral	cameras capture moments .
141_ 2	neutral	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
236_ 16	neutral	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
220_ 25	neutral	get one now !
227_ 1	neutral	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
228_ 12	positive	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
312_ 8	positive	but , i would definately recommend this phone .
220_ 3	positive	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
151_ 12	negative	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
214_ 5	neutral	what kind of a company does that !
142_ 2	positive	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
155_ 29	positive	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
121_ 4	neutral	the nikon 's are great cameras .
270_ 18	neutral	it 's no problem for me personally .
266_ 6	neutral	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
221_ 6	negative	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
109_ 12	positive	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
115_ 22	neutral	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
186_ 10	neutral	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
173_ 74	negative	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
309_ 19	negative	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
208_ 11	negative	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
140_ 10	positive	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
216_ 1	negative	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
184_ 1	neutral	first there 's the unit itself .
208_ 6	negative	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
167_ 7	neutral	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
308_ 0	neutral	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
117_ 1	positive	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
134_ 16	neutral	this is not a handbag camera .
285_ 15	neutral	thumbs down on that one .
304_ 3	positive	overall an excellent phone .
193_ 33	positive	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
301_ 7	positive	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
230_ 3	neutral	cons :
121_ 10	neutral	photos had some artifacts and noise .
149_ 3	positive	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
186_ 67	neutral	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
290_ 20	neutral	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
231_ 30	neutral	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
274_ 4	positive	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
194_ 0	neutral	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
245_ 6	neutral	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
242_ 8	neutral	card reader is included .
206_ 2	neutral	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
186_ 41	positive	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
287_ 9	neutral	best regards sadoun satellite sales
146_ 9	neutral	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
193_ 29	negative	i forgot , the case does n't fit .
237_ 3	neutral	it says i have a harddisk problem .
146_ 1	positive	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
306_ 1	positive	the radio feature has superb sound quality .
225_ 7	neutral	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , "" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , "" or something to that effect .
190_ 3	positive	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
274_ 14	negative	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
195_ 20	neutral	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
148_ 19	neutral	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
136_ 2	positive	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
290_ 31	neutral	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
140_ 23	neutral	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
190_ 4	positive	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
224_ 8	neutral	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
209_ 2	positive	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
274_ 42	negative	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
204_ 9	neutral	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
269_ 8	neutral	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
254_ 4	neutral	no instructions .
292_ 2	positive	the phones are awesome .
108_ 8	neutral	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
115_ 13	positive	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
215_ 3	positive	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
274_ 19	neutral	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
310_ 4	neutral	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
152_ 5	negative	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
243_ 4	neutral	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software "" nikon view "" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
182_ 5	positive	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
226_ 19	neutral	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
161_ 4	neutral	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
207_ 11	positive	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
241_ 1	neutral	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
186_ 55	neutral	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
258_ 9	negative	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
147_ 4	positive	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
235_ 0	negative	what a junk .
108_ 9	positive	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
175_ 9	negative	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
140_ 32	neutral	added 2-24 .
229_ 1	neutral	the pros :
111_ 1	positive	takes excellent photos .
121_ 14	neutral	fiance did n't like the feel .
287_ 0	positive	one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
308_ 3	neutral	and how can i do that ... .
186_ 26	neutral	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
286_ 4	neutral	aight den bumpy ?
209_ 3	positive	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
129_ 9	negative	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
131_ 5	neutral	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
258_ 0	neutral	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
290_ 37	neutral	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
192_ 1	neutral	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
145_ 4	neutral	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
231_ 23	positive	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
148_ 7	neutral	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
188_ 3	positive	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
288_ 11	neutral	it did have scored over all other competitors ....
140_ 30	neutral	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
217_ 14	neutral	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
147_ 0	neutral	for me the sound of the music is what is important .
231_ 22	neutral	software :
161_ 23	neutral	that was n't pretty .
236_ 8	positive	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
200_ 35	neutral	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
197_ 33	neutral	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
226_ 2	neutral	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
193_ 22	positive	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
217_ 1	neutral	i 've compared and compared and compared .
165_ 3	positive	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
247_ 7	positive	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
265_ 5	neutral	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
157_ 0	positive	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
154_ 2	positive	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
175_ 3	positive	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
135_ 0	positive	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
217_ 5	positive	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
174_ 2	positive	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
227_ 51	negative	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
304_ 1	neutral	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
297_ 3	neutral	the downside though , may be a big one for you .
114_ 0	neutral	i bought this last week through amazon .
290_ 34	neutral	oh well ..
187_ 12	neutral	well that was not a simple task .
164_ 14	positive	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
208_ 14	neutral	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
282_ 6	positive	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
244_ 5	neutral	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
127_ 5	neutral	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
298_ 3	neutral	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
150_ 5	positive	the other controls are all very easy to use .
117_ 7	neutral	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
145_ 11	negative	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
285_ 33	negative	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
215_ 46	neutral	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
220_ 12	neutral	awesome feature .
200_ 21	neutral	review of zen xtra - 40 gb
254_ 9	neutral	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
230_ 1	neutral	pros :
174_ 6	neutral	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
153_ 12	neutral	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
148_ 6	neutral	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
227_ 13	positive	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
191_ 28	neutral	gee ... thanks a lot creative .
227_ 32	positive	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
199_ 4	positive	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
231_ 4	positive	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
208_ 12	neutral	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
110_ 1	neutral	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
126_ 9	positive	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
300_ 6	positive	i simply love this feature .
160_ 0	positive	i love this player .
217_ 3	positive	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
298_ 7	positive	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
227_ 7	neutral	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
154_ 9	positive	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
213_ 17	negative	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
173_ 41	neutral	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
197_ 8	neutral	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
274_ 46	neutral	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
173_ 49	neutral	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
197_ 3	positive	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
186_ 36	neutral	you have to add them to the playing list .
300_ 10	positive	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
132_ 0	neutral	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
310_ 9	neutral	i like the default blue .
184_ 3	positive	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
155_ 11	positive	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
138_ 3	neutral	i called them twice and both times they said it is "" about to ship "" .
179_ 9	negative	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
218_ 8	negative	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
197_ 10	positive	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
215_ 14	neutral	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
158_ 6	neutral	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
251_ 5	positive	downloads are a snap and quick .
212_ 2	neutral	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
134_ 4	positive	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
123_ 15	neutral	perhaps there is a way around this delay .
165_ 13	positive	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
165_ 14	neutral	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
127_ 11	negative	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
104_ 10	negative	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
300_ 18	neutral	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
216_ 2	neutral	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
212_ 5	neutral	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
236_ 23	neutral	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
151_ 13	positive	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
109_ 10	neutral	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
215_ 16	positive	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
134_ 6	neutral	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
161_ 19	neutral	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
234_ 19	neutral	this is all i have to say .
288_ 4	positive	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
227_ 42	negative	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
220_ 7	positive	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
148_ 16	positive	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
162_ 17	positive	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
213_ 31	neutral	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
193_ 9	neutral	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
230_ 4	negative	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
231_ 1	positive	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
217_ 4	neutral	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
197_ 27	neutral	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
246_ 12	neutral	a few things that might make it even better :
209_ 7	negative	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
119_ 17	positive	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
148_ 10	positive	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
246_ 0	neutral	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
310_ 8	neutral	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
152_ 0	neutral	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
175_ 10	neutral	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
213_ 8	neutral	now i know better .
279_ 3	neutral	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
186_ 54	neutral	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
297_ 1	neutral	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
218_ 2	neutral	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
185_ 0	neutral	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
248_ 7	neutral	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
282_ 29	neutral	battery life :
258_ 16	neutral	it is easy to "" focus "" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
227_ 41	neutral	1 .
157_ 14	positive	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
282_ 0	positive	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
183_ 0	neutral	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
307_ 7	neutral	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile "" hot-spots "" .
228_ 4	neutral	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
173_ 34	positive	the storage capacity is great .
253_ 2	neutral	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
151_ 11	negative	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
170_ 31	neutral	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
170_ 24	negative	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
290_ 26	neutral	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
110_ 2	positive	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
121_ 9	neutral	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
155_ 1	neutral	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
246_ 20	neutral	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
153_ 6	neutral	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
262_ 14	neutral	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
194_ 2	neutral	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
186_ 48	neutral	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
194_ 11	negative	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
140_ 5	positive	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
277_ 11	negative	the vibration is not top .
208_ 22	neutral	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
187_ 1	positive	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
208_ 24	neutral	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
124_ 4	neutral	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
310_ 33	positive	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
186_ 46	negative	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .

829	neutral	These statements show the depravity of this man's beliefs. They must incite hatred and encourage terrorism, and I would encourage the Metropolitan Police to investigate them as rigorously as possible.
1069	neutral	The commission has received a proposal to extend decommissioning by Bulgaria. The Commission is assessing the proposal. It has not been approved,
731	positive	England need another batsman to establish himself. Andrew Strauss is good. Alastair Cook is going to be very good. Kevin Pietersen is unbelievable. Paul Collingwood is steady but Owais Shah and Ian Bell have shown only glimpses.
1160	negative	it is not conscionable that Shalit is living there without being able to see his parents, while Hamas prisoners live here almost like in a summer camp.
491	neutral	We are looking very carefully at the implications of this decision for the WTO case,
439	positive	Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position. His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration. I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him, and I am glad they did the right thing,
452	positive	I extend my condolences to the Fatah party and the Palestinian national authority. Fatah has always sacrificed its prominent members, for the Palestinian cause,
1179	positive	He (Tendulkar) is an amazing batsman. The kind of shots he plays is amazing,
1385	neutral	We are going to get some more commentary out of Geithner and maybe some more detail on the bank rescue so we'll see if that helps or if it hurts,
1203	negative	We cannot continue with a postcode lottery where people like the Tadley residents can't have access to NHS dentistry.

1218	positive	We also welcome the increased focus on supporting the Afghan National Security Forces to almost double in size and also the issue of focus on development for both Afghanistan and Pakistan,
758	neutral	The NAO rightly acknowledges the progress made with the Type 45 destroyer programme. Key milestones, such as completion of sea trials have been met ahead of schedule. These are complex, sophisticated warships and where problems arose in the early stages MOD gripped the issue, renegotiated contracts where required and got the programme on track - the first of these impressive destroyers, HMS Daring, sailed into Portsmouth, her future base port in January this year. I have been following this programme closel
613	neutral	RNC Chairman Michael Steele and elected Republicans are focused on fighting for reform and winning elections. The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,
508	neutral	With an Oceania qualifier still outstanding it is quite likely that we will have Samoa in our pool again, which will also be a tough one. For the first time in our World Cup participation since 1995 we will play another African team in the Pool phase, which will be challenging.
661	neutral	In the laws of crows there is no Supreme Court or Jirga system. They have one slogan and that is, ‘blood for blood',
751	neutral	We must make a greater contribution towards renewable energy and look at the hydro-electric potential of the Southern African Development Community.
295	neutral	It would be insane for the UK to take any of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners just because Brussels wants to cuddle up to President Obama. This is a classic case where the British Government should tell the EU where to go.
441	neutral	To have a successful presidency, the social life of the White House has to match the times. That's when it becomes such an added benefit to the presidency. It happened in its greatest form with the Kennedys,

466	neutral	Al Qaeda has succeeded in regenerating itself over the last seven years, and it is again a threat to the United States homeland and to American influence around the world and to our allies around the world,
1545	negative	When it comes to the banks squandering their customers' money ... I have discovered that it wasn't only Sir Fred who was getting money off RBS, it was also the right honourable member opposite who got £30,000 off the Royal Bank of Scotland for just two after-dinner speeches.
833	neutral	It is said that Pawar has friends in all states. But it should be kept in mind that all his friends too are eyeing for the top slot and are not expected to clear ground for him for prime ministership (if UPA comes to power),
624	neutral	After the game I spoke with the captain, Didier Drogba, my brother [Kolo Touré] and the coach. Behind this victory was a tragedy and it's difficult because they are Ivory Coast supporters and we know them well,
1262	neutral	It does look like most OPEC members are still pushing for a cut.
509	neutral	So far in this group, Bulgaria have drawn all of their three World Cup qualifying matches,
442	neutral	In his White House run, Obama assailed the economic policies of his predecessor, President George W Bush. But the dismal deficit figures, if they prove to be accurate, would amount to more than four times the deficits of Bush's presidency and raise the prospect that Obama and his Democratic allies c ontrolling Congress would have to consider raising taxes after the recession ends. By the auditors' calculation, Obama's budget would generate deficits averaging almost $1 trillion a year of red ink over 2010-2
905	neutral	Fox News Sunday.
344	neutral	The decision on captaincy was taken by keeping into account three considerations. One, player's availability during each phase of the tournament; two, flexibility in selection of playing squad during the phases; and three, the fact that Dravid will not be available due to personal reasons for the entire tournament,
1114	negative	I cannot accept the approach of some of Europe's leaders, who view Hamas as the symbol of responsibility and peace, failing to understand that it is a murderous terror organization preventing peace,
1229	neutral	It will help them [Hughes and Clark] for the fact that they will get to play some cricket and probably get a good amount of cricket under their belt, but I'm not sure they'll learn too much about themselves or about the England Test team though by playing those few county games,
997	neutral	Every gun or bullet tells a story. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS) helps police unravel that story and track down offenders. NABIS's specialist CSI-style analysis of ballistics - effectively giving guns and bullets a fingerprint which can be tracked - will help police to match guns to offenders in double quick time.
713	negative	There is only one demand, that's the departure of Ravalomanana,
1051	negative	The commonplace dodge between PSD and PDL, but especially the reelection of Traian Basescu are two major reasons for PNL to close ranks and to position ourselves as the only alternative to the current (non)governance,
505	neutral	There is only one country that will host this World Cup and that is South Africa. The World Cup in South Africa is for all Africans,
736	neutral	I would like to insist in agreement with the president that the mechanism used to deploy the money is the one that represents the Palestinian Authority,
368	neutral	Mugabe is going to try to hold onto his man (Gono) as much as he can because I don't think he wants to create an impression that the men and women who have been with him through thick and thin are expendable,
488	neutral	The EPP-ED Group is already preparing, together with the EPP Party, the nomination of the new European Commission. It is important that the transition period between the elections and the nomination of the Commission President is a short as possible, so that Europe can continue to actively build the future in these times which are so difficult for many citizens.
916	neutral	I hope that Ed Miliband has taken steps to ensure that there is no conflict of interest. 'While the publication of the list of ministers
457	neutral	The conditions have deteriorated to such an extent in Pakistan that the Sri Lankan cricket team was attacked on a tour and had to leave mid-way. Has Zardari solved the problems (of al-Qaeda and Taliban militancy) in Swat and other tribal areas? Is he serving the country or ruining it?
1191	positive	At such a time, Karl Eikenberry brings exceptionally valuable skills to the table,
424	neutral	My message to the PKK is to end the violence, to end the armed conflict,

1012	neutral	I grew up in a polarized world that was basically East-West. That's the Cold War,

636	neutral	Our biggest problem at the moment is who is going to give us money. If the money is available who should it be given to, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe or the Ministry of Finance? Should it be given to commercial banks or someone else?
803	neutral	His manner of communication points to his ignorance of the difference in jurisdiction between the Interior Ministry and the police,

341	negative	Rick Wagoner stands for an imploded centralist system,
1556	positive	I have had upwards of 10 interactions with Kayani. He wants to do the right thing for Pakistan. But he is in a very tough spot,
785	neutral	It is in the common interest of everyone here today therefore that this network functions efficiently, reliably and transparently into the future. It is a system which supplies gas to 16 European countries -- 12 of which are EU member states. We cannot afford for it to become -- very frankly -- an unreliable conduit, as it was for a few dark weeks in January,
467	negative	I certainly support the president keeping the American people safe from Al Qaeda,
887	neutral	I arrived at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education, which is an 18-story building in Harare,
1561	neutral	Of course the collapse of a government holding the EU Presidency is nothing to celebrate, not least during an economic crisis. It is however the democratic right of a national parliament to express a vote of no confidence in its government, even one with this extra responsibility. If the EU institutions assume their responsibilities correctly and the rotating Presidency maintains its role coordinating Council meetings, this need not be too serious an issue. However it is not the case today that our institut

1481	positive	We are aware of the huge significance of the 15 April date for both Liverpool FC and their fans, and that is why we will do our utmost to make sure that the club does not have to play its Uefa Champions League second leg quarter-final match on that day. I have been in regular correspondence with Liverpool for some time and fully sympathise with the club's feelings as to the importance of respecting the date of 15 April for those who lost their lives at Hillsborough.
1534	neutral	One consisting of 20 people or more would continue working in Georgia. The other one consisting of eight people, as before within the old OSCE Mission in Georgia, would operate in the regions adjacent to Georgia from the side of South Ossetia,

1239	neutral	We will now contest in 28 out of 40 seats in Bihar as per our seat sharing pact with the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP). We will work to defeat communal forces,
1283	neutral	I am waiting for the Congress' reply as they asked for 48 hours' time. But five days have gone so far and the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) has already begun their poll campaign across the state,

699	neutral	This is the price of New Labour's
1457	positive	This is a dream come true for 11 of our member countries. It will surely help to lift the bar of football in these countries. My sincere hope is that the governments and business organisations join with us in this FIFA initiative that will take the sport to even greater heights

793	neutral	We believe this referendum serves to extend the life of the Aliev regime,
499	negative	Getting someone else to take the rap is a classic device, but John Denham cannot escape responsibility for this mess. Now the focus must be on tackling the serious crisis that threatens the viability of colleges and the training prospects of thousands of young people.

374	neutral	With South Africa having just concluded its Human Rights Day celebrations, it beggars belief that our government would go out of its way to block the Dalai Lama -- an apostle of peace, who is revered throughout the world for his unwavering commitment to non-violence, human rights and cultural freedom -- from entering the country,
352	neutral	. Outgoing Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni had earlier warned that Israel would not shy away from striking Gaza in response to persistent rocket fire. If it turns out that Hamas has not got the message, it will be hit again,

1392	positive	I look forward to meeting with my NATO counterparts and discussing with them our common interests and shared security concerns,
1089	neutral	We discussed this question especially as Mr Muallem came here with a high-ranking security official, which is confirmation of the will of the Syrians to solve this problem,
1417	neutral	The radar will be there. If it is there later, it does not matter, it is a project that has a European dimension, NATO dimension, and in this sense, I do not expect Obama to make any...negative statement,
1247	neutral	With OPEC cutting and the refiners operating at low levels, any builds that we're seeing are really indicating poor demand,
1376	positive	I haven't made the team yet but Walcott and Eduardo will certainly be in the squad. The more resources you have the better it is and they are two guys who can score goals,

He went on:

The Democrats' problem is that the American people are growing skeptical of the massive government spending being pushed by congressional leaders like [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi,

773	neutral	We intend to do whatever we can to encourage maximum take up of this exemption by our member states. Micro entities could save as much as €1,200 each year, if member states follow our lead on this one. In the current climate, that is no mean saving,
1442	neutral	Lately, for reasons connected also with internal policy, with the extended discord and with successive electoral years, our influence in NATO and Europe is not there where we hoped to maintain and develop it,
1338	negative	He has been up front about what he views and hasn't stepped back from that, which is he hopes for failure. He said it and I compliment him for his honesty. But that's their philosophy that is enunciated by Rush Limbaugh and I think that's the wrong philosophy for America ,
1258	positive	Our message is that non-OPEC (countries) should join OPEC (in helping the market) and we emphasize that a price lower than the current one does not have a justification at all and it stops development,
361	neutral	The reasons that China gives for blocking Coca-Cola should be a test for whether Chinalco should be allowed to invest in Rio Tinto. If you applied the exact same criteria, then Chinalco is out,

647	neutral	I complained to the coach (Jurgen Klinsmann) about the fact that I never have enough support when I want to attack on the left side,
395	neutral	He is registered to vote in the constituency which he serves. The Mail on Sunday has suggested he is deliberately concealing the fact that his main residence is in Hammersmith. There is no substance to this allegation.

844	neutral	It [JLP] will be disappointed that profits are down so much, but M&S is going to be way down. John Lewis still has pricing power and is one of the few retailers that has.
1153	neutral	There was an agreement through the Egyptian mediator that Israel releases 450 Palestinian prisoners whose names were submitted by Hamas in exchange for Schalit,
589	neutral	So bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the political implications, particularly throughout the European Union, of that, the parties find operating as they do to be a more diplomatic and successful way to operate, that's all. I think that is sort of understandable, if I can put it that way,
304	neutral	The budget President Obama has proposed isn't the same-old document Washington has come to expect year after year,
940	neutral	If you want to win the Champions League you have to play with the best in Europe. So we'll take the challenge,

1560	neutral	Regarding the different candidacies, as you know we are subject to the decision of our Irish friends for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and depending on that, we will ask ourselves the question,
1354	negative	I'm still left without much information about how Microsoft is ensuring American workers are being protected or specifics of its H-1B visa hiring practices,
363	positive	It will be an intense match. Ireland has Trapattoni, who is a great coach,
1516	neutral	If the Government meets the ultimatum of the Alliance for Georgia and calls a referendum, the rest of the opposition will join the initiative. If the Government snubs the referendum call then Alasania's Alliance will have to embrace the idea of the demonstrations. So, much will be seen when the term of the ultimatum expires,
652	neutral	On Saturday, I went to the Supreme Court asking for the date of the hearing and also to submit my defence,
1052	neutral	Comrade Basescu got scared of Crin Antonescu and realizes that as time passes, the chances of Basescu to be reelected decrease and the chances of Crin Antonescu increase. I don't think that this is a decision, but definitely Berceanu did not make this declaration at random, he probably wanted to test the reactions of the public opinions to such a political move,

806	neutral	We will look to have further discussions and our overriding ective within that is to press Hezbollah to play a more constructive role, particularly to move away from violence,
482	neutral	I am deeply concerned by the decision of the Sudanese authorities to revoke the operating licences of a number of leading international NGOs. If these and all other international NGOs are no longer authorised to work in the country, then the continuation of humanitarian life-saving operations in Darfur will be in serious jeopardy. This can have dramatic consequences: the very lives of hundreds of thousands of people would be at risk as these NGOs provide a lifeline to so many innocent people. I urge the Gov
1494	positive	A rights body is not only a campaign on behalf of ASEAN. We are very serious about its establishment, and Indonesia will make sure it sets an example for it. ASEAN is not only about pursuing prosperity, but also democracy, and that includes the rule of law, protection of human rights, and freedom of press. Indonesia will play an active role to make sure the rights body has proper functions,

789	neutral	It is clear that today's outcome will not kill off the proposals to extend copyright term, but rather that member states need more time to consider that details of the proposal and reach an agreement,
426	negative	Once the PKK is eliminated there are no bounds to what is possible: you are our neighbours and kinsmen.
1467	positive	Just as the State of Israel is committed all the way to bringing back a captive soldier and locating a missing fighter, this is what we are doing these days to speed up the return of Gilad Shalit, national commitment is strong before you and your loved ones,
